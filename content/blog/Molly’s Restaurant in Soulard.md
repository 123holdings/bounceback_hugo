  I had dinner today at Molly’s Restaurant in Soulard. The food there was some of the best food I’ve eater had in any restaurant. We had crab cakes and “firecracker shrimp” for an appetizer, and Jambalaya and a flat iron steak for the main course. The food was amazing and it was plated like a 5 star restaurant.
