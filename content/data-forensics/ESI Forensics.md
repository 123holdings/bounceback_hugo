## Description:

Electronically stored information (ESI) can reveal clues or information that can be of vital importance to the outcome of legal proceedings or investigations. Electronic data, which can be stored in any number of operating systems such as **Windows, Mac and Linux**, and file formats such as **PST (MS Outlook), NSF (Lotus Notes)**, email and e-files, can be a critical source of electronic evidence in litigation.

Computer forensics has been used in a number of high profile cases and is becoming widely accepted as reliable within US court systems. At BounceBack Data Recovery we have the expertise and certifications to provide the highest security environment for data forensic work. We will happily sign a non-disclosure agreement.

Our engineers follow a chain of custody protocol similar to those implemented by law enforcement organizations. All of your sensitive media is stored in a fireproof safe when not being worked on and during closing hours. This ensures your data is protected from theft, flood, fire, and physical damage.

You will have direct phone access to the engineer working on your case throughout every stage of the process. Any encrypted data can be recovered and transferred to an alternate medium, ensuring the integrity of any private encryption keys. BounceBack Data Recovery has earned the following certifications to ensure the security of ESI:

### ISO 14644-1 Clean Room Certification (Class 100 Clean Room)

This certification covers the classification of cleanliness as it pertains to cleanrooms and other controlled environments. Our experts only work on your drives in a safe certified ISO cleanroom environment to prevent any further damage to the sensitive components found within. Strict adherence to ISO 14644-1 guidelines is also verified by an outside auditor.

### Cisco Self-Defending Network

Our network must be able to respond to intrusions while maintaining availability and reliability. If our network isn’t safe, your data isn’t safe. That’s why we have implemented a Cisco Self-Defending Network that remains active at all times, and can even react to an intrusion with no human interaction. Our network is constantly monitored, giving us plenty of time to focus on recovering your data.

### ISO 9001:2008 Certification

When customers trust a company to do a job properly, ISO Certification is the definitive basis for that trust. ISO 9001:2008 standards are a quality management system designed to help organizations meet customer needs. This means that BounceBack Data Recovery must adhere to strict guidelines and procedures from the beginning of the data recovery process to the end. Adherence to these guidelines is verified by an outside auditor. This ensures that none of our customers or our jobs slips through the cracks or receives substandard service. We do it right every time, and if a non-compliance issue arises it is addressed and remedied immediately.
