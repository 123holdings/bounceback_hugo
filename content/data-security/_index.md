## Description:

When choosing a data recovery company, the primary concern for businesses, educators, and government entities is the security of their confidential data. It requires a high level of trust to grant an outside party access to classified files and sensitive information. Companies and individuals need to protect themselves against theft, adhere to legal obligations such as maintaining a chain of custody, and know that their valuable storage media will not be damaged. BounceBack Data Recovery has obtained some of the top industry certifications and training to ensure that all data that comes to our site is handled with the ultimate level of security from the beginning of the process to the end.

### Encrypted Data Recovery

BounceBack Data Recovery’s engineers have years of experience in retrieving file-level and disk-level encrypted data. We create sector-by-sector images of your drive during the data recovery process to ensure that your data is not compromised. This image can then be transferred to a separate drive and returned to you with the original encryption. In this fashion, we can recover your data for you without you having to release your encryption key to an outside entity should you choose not to do so.
