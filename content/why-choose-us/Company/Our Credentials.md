## Description:

BounceBack Data Recovery has earned the following industry certifications to give our customers the peace of mind that their valuable data will be recovered in a safe and secure work environment.

ISO 9001:2008 Certification (this certification has lapsed and needs to be renewed)

When customers trust a company to do a job properly, ISO Certification is the definitive basis for that trust. ISO 9001:2008 standards are a quality management system designed to help organizations meet customer needs. This means that BounceBack Data Recovery must adhere to strict guidelines and procedures from the beginning of the data recovery process to the end. Adherence to these guidelines is verified by an outside auditor. This ensures that none of our customers or our jobs slips through the cracks or receives substandard service. We do it right every time, and if a non-compliance issue arises it is addressed and remedied immediately.
