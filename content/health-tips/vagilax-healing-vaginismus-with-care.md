### VagiLax – Overcoming Vaginismus with Science, Sensitivity, and Support at Oasis Clinics

At **Oasis Clinics**, we’re proud to introduce **VagiLax**, a specialized program developed by <a href="https://oasisclinics.com/doctors/dr.-abdel-maguid-ramzy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Dr. AbdelMaguid Ramzy</strong></a>, a leading scholar, practitioner, and founder of the **VagiLax Medical Center**, dedicated to helping women overcome **vaginismus** and dismantle cultural taboos around female sexual health in the Middle East.<br><br>💡 What Is Vaginismus & Why It Matters

Vaginismus occurs when the pelvic floor muscles (especially the **pubococcygeus, or “PC” muscles**) contract involuntarily during penetration, whether in sexual intercourse, a gynecological exam, or tampon insertion.<br>This reflex contraction can cause:

* ⚡ Severe pain
* 💔 Emotional distress
* 🚫 Avoidance of intimacy

The condition is **not rare**, but too often, it’s misunderstood or hidden by shame. The truth is, **vaginismus is treatable** when approached holistically and compassionately.

### 🧠 The VagiLax Approach: Science Meets Sensitivity

Dr. Ramzy’s method combines physical therapy, neuroscience, and psychological care, addressing vaginismus not only as a muscular disorder but as a **mind–body condition** influenced by emotion and culture.

Key features include:<br>🔹 **Comprehensive assessment** – detailed medical and psychological evaluation<br>🔹 **Integrated physical + psychological therapy** – retraining the body to relax rather than contract<br>🔹 **Botulinum toxin A (BTXA)** – used selectively to reduce involuntary muscle spasm<br>🔹 **Continuous follow-up** – WhatsApp, calls, or video sessions ensure full recovery and support

Each step of the program is **personalized**, evidence-based, and grounded in empathy.

### 🏥 Why Oasis Clinics Offers VagiLax

* ✅ A safe, medically supervised space
