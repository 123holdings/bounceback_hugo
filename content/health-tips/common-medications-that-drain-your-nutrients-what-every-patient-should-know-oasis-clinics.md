#### **The Hidden Side Effect of Common Medications: Nutrient Depletion and What You Can Do About It**

When we think of medication side effects, we often imagine what we hear in fast-talking TV ads: nausea, dizziness, drowsiness. But one of the most overlooked and under-discussed effects of many common drugs is **nutrient depletion**, a slow drain on your body’s essential vitamins and minerals that can quietly undermine your energy, mood, immunity, and even organ function.

At Oasis Clinics, we believe patients deserve to understand not just what their medications are treating, but also how they may be **silently impacting their nutrition**.

#### 🧬 What Is Drug-Induced Nutrient Depletion?

Certain medications can interfere with:

* **Absorption** of nutrients in the gut
* **Storage** and **activation** of vitamins and minerals
* **Excretion** of essential compounds through urine
* **Microbiome balance**, which is key for vitamin production

Over time, this can lead to **deficiencies** in magnesium, B vitamins, zinc, vitamin D, and other nutrients that are vital to energy, brain function, hormone balance, immune defense, and more.

#### **1\. Proton Pump Inhibitors – PPIs** (e.g., Omeprazole, Pantoprazole)

**Used for:** GERD, acid reflux<br>**Depletes:** Magnesium, Vitamin B12, Iron, Calcium<br>**Scientific Impact:**<br>Chronic acid suppression reduces nutrient absorption and alters the gut microbiome, increasing the risk of anemia, osteoporosis, neuropathy, and dysbiosis.

#### **2\. Statins** (e.g., Atorvastatin, Simvastatin)

**Used for:** High cholesterol<br>**Depletes:** Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)<br>**Scientific Impact:**<br>Inhibits CoQ10 synthesis via HMG-CoA reductase pathway, reducing mitochondrial energy production and increasing risk of muscle pain, fatigue, and cognitive fog.

> ***Disclaimer:** While some studies suggest that statins may reduce CoQ10 levels and contribute to muscle-related side effects, the evidence supporting CoQ10 supplementation for statin-induced symptoms remains mixed. Supplementation is considered possibly beneficial, but not definitively proven. Always consult your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.*

#### **3\. Metformin**

**Used for:** Type 2 diabetes, PCOS<br>**Depletes:** Vitamin B12, Folate<br>**Scientific Impact:**<br>Interferes with calcium-dependent B12 absorption in the ileum, leading to macrocytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive decline over time.

#### **4\. Oral Contraceptives**

**Used for:** Birth control, cycle regulation<br>**Depletes:** B6, B12, Folate, Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin C<br>**Scientific Impact:**<br>Enhances hepatic metabolism and urinary excretion of micronutrients involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, methylation, and antioxidant defense.

#### **5\. Diuretics** (e.g., Furosemide, Hydrochlorothiazide)

**Used for:** Hypertension, heart failure<br>**Depletes:** Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Thiamine, Zinc<br>**Scientific Impact:**<br>Promotes urinary loss of electrolytes and water-soluble vitamins, increasing risks for arrhythmias, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and cardiac decompensation.

#### **6\. ACE Inhibitors / ARBs** (e.g., Lisinopril, Losartan)

**Used for:** Hypertension, kidney protection<br>**Depletes:** Zinc<br>**Scientific Impact:**<br>Enhances renal zinc excretion, impairing enzymatic functions critical for immunity, tissue repair, and hormonal signaling.

#### **7\. Antibiotics (Broad-Spectrum)**

**Used for:** Bacterial infections<br>**Depletes:** Gut flora, Vitamin K, B vitamins<br>**Scientific Impact:**<br>Disrupts microbial production of key vitamins and weakens mucosal immunity, often resulting in fatigue, digestive upset, or secondary infections post-treatment.

#### **8\. Anticonvulsants** (e.g., Phenytoin, Valproate, Topiramate)

**Used for:** Epilepsy, bipolar disorder, migraines<br>**Depletes:** Folate, Vitamin D, Calcium, Vitamin K, Biotin, Carnitine<br>**Scientific Impact:**<br>Induce hepatic enzymes and interfere with absorption, contributing to bone loss, bleeding risk, mood instability, and mitochondrial dysfunction—especially with long-term use.

### **9\. GLP‑1 Agonists (e.g., Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus)**

**Used for:** Obesity, type 2 diabetes<br>**Depletes/Disrupts:** Nutrients, gut health, muscle mass, heart structure

**Scientific Impact:**<br>GLP‑1 receptor agonists mimic the glucagon-like peptide-1 hormone, lowering blood sugar, reducing appetite, and delaying gastric emptying. Some studies show up to 15–20% body-weight loss in a year. They can also offer kidney protection and possibly slow neurodegeneration and cardiovascular risk .

**But there’s a serious downside:**

* **Short-term side effects**: nausea, headaches, fatigue, mood shifts.
* **Nutrient deficiencies**: long-term use may impair vitamin/mineral absorption and alter gut flora.
* **Muscle loss**: Up to 40% of weight loss may be lean mass, potentially increasing metabolic decline.
* **Heart structure changes**: Semaglutide shrank cardiac muscle in mouse and human cell studies.
* **Rebound weight gain**: Appetite-suppression effects return to baseline after one year if treatment stops.
* **Non-responders**: About 20% of patients show minimal weight loss.

**Bottom Line:**<br>GLP‑1 drugs can jumpstart weight loss but don’t address root metabolic health. They warrant cautious use, ideally combined with tailored nutrition (high-protein, resistance training, gut support) and ongoing medical monitoring.

#### 🧠 Functional Medicine Perspective

In functional medicine, we always ask: *“Why?”*<br>Why are you tired, foggy, or anxious? Why did your bloodwork shift?

**Medication-induced nutrient depletion is one hidden root cause that deserves more attention, and it’s one you can do something about.**

#### 📌 Final Thoughts & Disclaimer

Your medications may be essential for managing your health, but they may also **silently deplete nutrients your body needs to thrive**.

Restoring what’s missing can make all the difference in how you feel.
