When diet is wrong, medicine is of no use. When diet is correct medicine is of no need - Ayurvedic Proverb.

Eating the right food is not just about the calorie count in order to reduce weight. It’s about eating the right foods that give you vitality and nourishment through phytonutrients; and skipping the foods that don’t. We have identified Nabat as a reliable partner to source pesticide- and herbicide-free foods full of phytonutrients.

When it comes to longevity, there are some superstar foods that really shine. Eat these phytonutrients often to improve your health-span. Many of these foods can be found at Nabat or other local organic vendors.

### Accessibility Note

While many of the foods listed here can be readily found in Egypt, we acknowledge that some may not be as readily available. This article however is intended for both our local and international audience who engage with our content. Make sure to always buy fresh. Do not buy canned / preserved alternatives.

We strive to provide valuable physician- and nutritionist- reviewed information to all our readers, regardless of location, helping everyone make informed choices about their nutrition and lifestyle. Whether you're based in Egypt or elsewhere, we aim to offer insights that are relevant and beneficial to your longevity and health journey.

### Important insights summed up

**Eat lots of plants**. About three-quarters of your plate should be covered with veggies. Aim for deep colours. Stick with mostly non-starchy veggies. Winter squashes and sweet potatoes are fine in moderation. Choose organic and regenerative when possible.

**Lighten up on fruits.** Low-glycemic fruits are best, so stick with berries, kiwis, and watermelon. Enjoy sweeter fruits only occasionally, such as grapes, melons, and higher-glycemic-index fruit. Always eat the whole fruit and avoid fruit juices. Think of dried fruit as candy and keep it to a minimum. When in doubt, get a continuous glucose monitor to track your body's response to different fruits.

**Load up on foods with healthy fats.** Whole foods such as nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocados, and small wild fatty fish such as sardines, mackerel, herring, anchovies, and wild salmon contain good fats. For oils, use extra virgin olive oil (at low or no heat), avocado oil (for higher-heat cooking), and organic virgin coconut oil.

**Hydrate adequately.** Just as important as what you eat is what you drink. Water is essential for every bodily function, from digestion to circulation to temperature regulation. Aim to drink at least 2 liters of water per day, but individual needs may vary depending on factors like climate, activity level, and overall health. Staying properly hydrated helps maintain energy levels, supports cognitive function, and promotes healthy skin.

**Add nuts and seeds.** They help with weight loss, diabetes, and heart disease and provide minerals, protein, good fats, fibre, and more. Almonds, walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, and pumpkin, hemp, chia, and sesame seeds are all great.

**Think of meat and animal products as condiments** not as a main course (which should be colourful vegetables). Servings should be palm-sized. Plant-based meals are fine as long as the protein comes from whole foods, not processed powders, bars, or fake meat. However, to get adequate protein for muscle synthesis as you age, you will need to supplement with animal protein and/or amino acid supplements or vegan protein powders with added amino acids.

**Buy animal products that have been regeneratively raised, grass-fed, or organic** when possible. They are nutritionally better for you and they are better for the planet. They are also rich in phytonutrients from all the wild and diverse plants the animals consume.

**Choose pasture-raised eggs.** They are an affordable source of protein and vitamins - including B12, which you can't get from a vegan diet - minerals, antioxidants, and more.

**Eat fish that is low in mercury and toxins, high in good fats, and wild-caught or sustainably raised.** Sardines, herring, anchovies, mackerel, and salmon all have high omega-3 and low mercury levels.

**Eat only whole grains (not whole-grain flours) and avoid gluten, especially from dwarf wheat.** Since all grains boost blood sugar, only eat 60 to 100 grams per day, and choose low glycemic, gluten-free grains like black rice, quinoa, teff, buckwheat, or amaranth.

**Eat beans.** Lentils are best. Stay away from big starchy beans as staples. Beans contain fibre, protein, and minerals, but some people don’t digest them well, and the lectins and phytates in beans can inhibit mineral and protein absorption. If you digest beans without a problem then up to 75 grams a day is ok.

**Avoid sugar** and other foods that spike blood sugar and insulin, such as flour, refined starches, and carbohydrates. Treat sugar in any form as an occasional treat. Your body can't tell the difference between a bagel and a bowl of sugar once it gets below your neck. Liquid sugar calories (from fizzy drinks, energy drinks, sweetened teas, even fruit juice, etc.) cause increased hunger, obesity, and death. Stay away.

**Eliminate most grain, bean, and seed oils.** That includes rapeseed, sunflower, grape seed, and especially corn and soybean oil. Small amounts of expeller or cold-pressed nut and seed oils like sesame, macadamia, and walnut oils are fine to use as condiments or for flavouring. Avocado oil is great for higher-temperature cooking.

**Avoid or limit dairy.** Conventional dairy is bad for the environment and most people don't digest it well. Dairy has been linked to inflammation, cancer, osteoporosis, autoimmune conditions, allergic disorders, digestive problems, and more. We recommend avoiding it, except for the occasional grass-fed dairy from yogurt, kefir, and grass-fed butter. Try goat or sheep products instead because they are raised on grass and their milk contains A2 casein, which is less likely to cause inflammation and digestive problems. And always go organic, grass-fed, and ideally regenerative.

**Reduce foods that have been contaminated with pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, and hormones.** Look for foods raised or grown in regenerative ways (good for the Earth and for humans), if possible. Check labels for chemicals, additives, preservatives, dyes, artificial sweeteners, or other nonfood ingredients. If you wouldn't find it in your kitchen for cooking, you shouldn't eat it.
