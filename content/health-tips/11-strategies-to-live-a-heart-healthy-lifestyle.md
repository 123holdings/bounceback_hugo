#### 11 Strategies to Live a Heart-Healthy Lifestyle

When you choose healthy behaviors, you can lower your heart disease risk while also preventing other serious chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, some kinds of cancer, and a range of other lifestyle diseases.

#### **1\. Learn Your Health History**

Understand your risk factors by discussing your health history with your family and doctor. Awareness is the first step towards prevention.

#### **2\. Eat a Healthy Diet**

Make healthy food choices like more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. Eat less salt, saturated fat, and added sugar. You can learn more about diets for a healthy heart in another dedicated article.

#### **3\. Move More, Sit Less:**

Get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week, plus muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days a week.

#### **4\. Quit Smoking**

Smoking cessation is a crucial step towards improving your heart health. Seek support and resources to begin your journey to quit.

#### **5\. Take Medicines Only as Directed**

If you take medicine to treat high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes, follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. Always ask questions if you don’t understand something. Never stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor or nurse.

#### **6\. Choose Your Drinks Wisely**

Opt for water over sugary drinks to cut down on calories. If consuming alcohol, do so in moderation, limiting to no more than one drink per day for women and two for men. But it’s better to cut it out completely. One to two cups of coffee at most preferably not after 3:00 PM

#### **7\. Monitor Your Blood Pressure at Home**

Utilise self-measured blood pressure monitors for easy and safe monitoring. Ask your doctor for guidance on proper usage if needed.

#### **8\. Get Good Quality Sleep**

Adequate sleep is essential for heart health, reducing risks of obesity, high blood pressure, heart attack, diabetes, and depression. Establish a consistent sleep routine (wake up & sleep at fixed times) and ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep (e.g. dim lights at night to enhance melatonin release, vital for sleep). If symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (such as loud snoring, breathing pauses during sleep, or gasping for air upon waking) are present, seek evaluation from your doctor

#### **9\. Manage Stress**

Some people cope with stress in unhealthy ways - such as overeating, drinking or smoking. Finding alternative ways to manage stress - such as physical activity, relaxation exercises, deep restorative practices, or meditation - can help improve your health.

#### **10\. Get Regular Health Screenings**

The most important are high blood pressure, blood sugar, and high cholesterol. In most cases, even significant elevations are completely silent until damage to an organ or a major complication occurs. They can damage the heart and blood vessels as well as most systems in the body. But without testing for them, you probably won't know whether you have these conditions at an early stage when management can save disease & lives. Regular screening can tell you what your numbers are and whether you need to take action.

* **Blood Pressure.** Regular blood pressure screenings usually start in childhood. Starting at age 18, blood pressure should be measured at least once every two years to screen for high blood pressure as a risk factor for heart disease and stroke.If you're between 18 and 39 and have risk factors for high blood pressure, you should be screened once a year. People aged 40 and older are also given a blood pressure test yearly.
* **Cholesterol Levels.** Adults generally have their cholesterol measured at least once every four to six years. Cholesterol screening usually starts at age 20, though earlier testing may be recommended if you have other risk factors, such as a family history of early-onset heart disease.
* **Type 2 Diabetes Screening.** Diabetes is a risk factor for heart disease. If you have risk factors for diabetes, such as being overweight or having a family history of diabetes, Oasis Clinics doctors may recommend early screening. Screening typically starts at age 45, with retesting every three years, unless you have risk factors that necessitate earlier or more frequent testing.

#### Important

If you have a condition such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes, among others, Oasis Clinics doctors may prescribe medications and recommend lifestyle changes. Make sure to take your medications exactly as your doctor prescribes while you follow a healthy lifestyle plan in order to address the root causes of the disease simultaneously.

While the strategies stem from evidence-based medicine, individual needs may vary. Always consult with your doctor before making significant changes to your lifestyle, especially if you have existing health conditions or concerns. It's important to note that this article serves as guidance only. Taking certain lifestyle changes to extremes can lead to adverse effects, including disorders such as bulimia or anorexia. Additionally, be mindful of food allergies when altering your diet. Extreme dietary restrictions or changes should be approached with caution and under professional guidance. The Oasis Clinics team is here to support you with personalized advice and treatment plans tailored to your unique health profile, ensuring that your journey toward a heart-healthy lifestyle is both safe and effective.
