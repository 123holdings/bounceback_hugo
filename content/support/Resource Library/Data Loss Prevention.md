## Description:

We all know that when someone loses their home to fire it’s the irreplaceable items that are missed the most. Photos, heirlooms, memories…all gone in a matter of minutes. The same thing is true for data loss. You can replace your computer, the hardware, and the software. But when the data is gone, it’s gone. Through proprietary methods and technology we at BounceBack Data Recovery are often able to salvage your valuable files. It would be better, though, if the data were never lost in the first place. Here are some steps to follow to help prevent future data loss or damage.

- Back Up Your Files: Keep all your important files in at least two locations. A hard drive crash can be caused by a mechanical problem or corrupt software…you may never see it coming. Fire or water damage does not send advance notice. By backing up your data and backing it up often, you stay a step ahead of disaster. For very important data, we recommend keeping your backup in a remote location from your computer. This will ensure your data is safe even in the event of fire or other unintentional damage.
- Only Allow Trusted People on Your Computer: Human error is one of the main causes of data loss. Only allow trusted users on your computer. Password-protect important files and do not share those passwords.
- Virus Protection: Protect your computer from viruses. There are countless virus protection programs available for your computer. Find the one that best fits your needs and keeping it running and updated at all times. Don’t download from websites you don’t trust!
- Properly Shut Down: Your computer is running and performing multiple tasks at all times! Do not interrupt the power supply or turn it off without following the proper shut down procedures. Use a battery back-up as insurance against power outages.
- Avoid Physical Damage: Your hard disk drive is composed of intricate moving parts. Do not kick, drop, or otherwise jolt your computer. Keep it away from water and other liquids. Use a surge protector to prevent damage from power surges. A power strip is not the same thing as a surge protector!
