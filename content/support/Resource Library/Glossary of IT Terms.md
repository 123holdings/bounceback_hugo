A

AA (application architecture)

The AA describes the layout of an application’s deployment. This generally includes partitioned application logic and deployment to application server engines. AAs rely less on specific tool or language technology than on standardized middleware options, communications protocols, data gateways, and platform infrastructures such as Component Object Model (COM), JavaBeans and Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). The application architect is tasked with specifying an AA and supporting the deployment implementation.

ABC (activity-based costing)

An improved approach to understanding where and why costs are incurred within an enterprise. It provides the information for activity-based management, which focuses on the decisions and actions needed to reduce costs and increase revenue. ABC differs from traditional cost accounting in explicitly recognizing that not all cost objects place an equal demand on support resources.

ABM (activity-based management)

The use of activity-based costing (ABC) principles in the ongoing management of costs and resources. See ABC.

Access Control Entry (ACE)

An Access Control Entry is the smallest unit of security. It contains a SID (either a user or a group) and permissions information. The permission will be one of Access Allowed, Access Denied or System Audit. This object has flags to determine how the permissions should be inherited. See also: SID, ACL and Auditing.

access method

The portion of a computer’s operating system responsible for formatting data sets and their direction to specific storage devices. Examples from the mainframe world include Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) and Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM).
In local-area networks, the technique or program code used to arbitrate the use of the communications medium by granting access selectively to individual stations. Examples are Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA-CD) and token passing.

ACE (See Access Control Entry)

ACL (See Access Control List)

ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority)

Regulator of broadcasting, radio communications, telecommunications and online content in Australia, formed from two earlier bodies, the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Broadcasting Authority.

ACT I (application, channel, technology and industry)

An acronym representing the “survival locations” for integrated document management (IDM) vendors. A survival location is a market segment where a vendor can develop sustainable competitive advantage. A critical mass of sustainable competitive advantage is necessary for a vendor to thrive in the long term in any market

active data dictionary

A facility for storing dynamically accessible and modifiable information relating to midrange-system data definitions and descriptions.

active Directory

The “directory service” portion of the Windows 2000 operating system. Active Directory manages the identities and relationships of the distributed resources that make up a network environment. It stores information about network-based entities (e.g., applications, files, printers and people) and provides a consistent way to name, describe, locate, access, manage and secure information about these resources. It the central authority that manages the identities and brokers the relationships between these distributed resources, enabling them to work together.

ActiveX

An application programming interface (API) that enhances Microsoft’s OLE protocol. Often compared to Java, ActiveX facilitates various Internet applications, and therefore extends and enhances the functionality of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser. Like Java, ActiveX enables the development of interactive content. When an ActiveX-aware browser encounters a Web page that includes an unfamiliar feature, it automatically installs the appropriate applications so the feature can be used.

AD (applications development)

The function of creating applications for an enterprise. The term refers not simply to programming, but to the larger overall process of defining application requirements, planning the application structure, developing the code, monitoring development progress and testing results.

adapters

Adapters are small, focused programs that expose functionality and/or data in a legacy application. Our use of this term includes not only the programs, but also the framework for designing and developing adapter programs. Adapters can be deceptively complex, with “thick” adapters performing a variety of functions that include recognizing events, collecting and transforming data, and exchanging data with platform, integration suite or other middleware. However, “thin” adapters may only “wrap” a native application interface, exposing another more-standard one for application access. Adapters can also handle exception conditions and can often dynamically (or with minor reconfiguration) accommodate new revisions of source or target applications.

Adapters are often sold in conjunction with integration middleware products, such as ESBs, integration suites or portal servers, or are offered as a stand-alone product, such as an adapter suite. Among the different adapters, high-level categories include technical and application adapters.

A comprehensive suite should include adapters for:

• Common technologies, such as COM, Enterprise JavaBeans and Web services
• Industry protocols, such as EDI, Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and RosettaNet
• Common applications, such as SAP or PeopleSoft
• Proprietary applications, such as an adapter development kit

ADF (automated document factory)

A term for an architecture and set of processes to manage the creation and delivery of mission-critical, high-volume digital documents. The ADF applies factory production concepts to the document production – raw materials, including data and preparation instructions, enter the ADF, where they are transformed into digital documents and prepared for delivery.

ADSL offers downstream data rates of up to 9 Mbps on short loops.

ADSL2

Among other improvements on basic ADSL, ADSL2 offers downstream data rates of up to 12 Mbps on short loops, and extends ADSL’s reach by approximately 600 feet.

ADSL2+

Among other improvements, ADSL2+ doubles the downstream frequency of ADSL2 and enables downstream data rates of more than 25 Mbps on short loops.

AD technology profile

A method of assessing an enterprise and its methodology. It includes:

• Development process profile: Life cycle coverage, ease of use, change management, methodologies supported, project management, information model, templates/componentware.
• Development technology profile: Workgroup support, development platform, repository, object-oriented (OO) component concepts, technical quality, openness, integration.
• Target environment profile: Execution platforms, human interface, database management systems, middleware supported, portability, communications protocols, execution technology, reliability.
• Application capabilities profile: Application topology, application types, complexity supported, transaction volume, security, usability support, type of users supported.
• (Built-in) execution environment profile: Application servers, middleware, database gateways, wrapper facilities, workflow engine, rules engine, dynamic repartitioning.

advanced technology

A technology that is still immature but promises to deliver significant value, or that has some technical maturity but still has relatively few users. Among current examples: artificial intelligence, agents, speech and handwriting recognition, virtual reality and 3-D visualization, smart cards, real-time collaboration, enhanced user authentication, data mining, and knowledge management.

agile NeoRAD

This type of project approach applies agile methods, such as extreme programming. Models are sketches, rather than first-class development artifacts. There are few concerns about standardization in terms of reusing analysis and design patterns and frameworks. There is little model-based code generation.

AHP (analytical hierarchy process)

A process that uses hierarchical decomposition to deal with complex information in multicriterion decision making, such as information technology vendor and product evaluation. It consists of three steps:

Developing the hierarchy of attributes germane to the selection of the IT vendor.
Identifying the relative importance of the attributes.
Scoring the alternatives’ relative performance on each element of the hierarchy.

Developed by Thomas Saaty while he was teaching at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, the AHP is recognized as the leading theory in multicriterion decision making.

AI (artificial intelligence)

A wide-ranging discipline of computer science that at its core seeks to make computers behave more like humans. The term was coined by John McCarthy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956. AI attempts to resolve problems by “reasoning,” similar to the process used by the human mind. AI involves the capability of a machine to learn (to remember results produced on a previous trial and to modify the operation accordingly in subsequent trials) or to reason (to analyze the results produced in similar operations and select the most favorable outcome). Today, applications of artificial intelligence include voice recognition, robotics, neural networks and expert systems (i.e., systems that can make decisions an expert would otherwise have to make to, for example, forecast financial performance, or diagnose illnesses).

AIM (AOL Instant Messenger)

A free, public instant-message service and one of the earliest. A variety of free client software is available, supporting Windows and Macintosh PCs, Palm operating system (OS), Microsoft’s Pocket PC and Symbian handheld devices. See also instant messaging (IM).

AM (asset management)

A system of practices intended to address shortcomings, inefficiencies, waste and unavoidable failures in managing technology and information technology equipment. It involves five major areas:

Requisition
Procurement
Deployment
Maintenance
Retirement strategies

At its core is an integrated data repository that contains:

• Asset tracking – technical information about the equipment or software
• Portfolio information – acquisition and financial details
• A contracts database – summarizing key software and maintenance contracts terms and conditions

AMD (architected, model-driven development)

AMD is the most sophisticated end of the SOA modeling spectrum. It focuses on quality, performance and reuse. It comes in two “flavors”: AMD composition and AMD development. AMD composition presumes that the needed services exist and can be “assembled” into an application (business service), possibly with a new user interface (generally portal-based, using Web services). Organizations can generally use AMD composition models to generate the specifications for use by workflow orchestration technologies in the runtime environment.

AMD development assumes that new organizations need to develop software services prior to composition. AMD development tools can reuse the same business models developed by those doing AMD composition. But, generally, IT personnel refine these into more detailed models to generate as much of the code as possible ― 70% to 100% ― depending on the service type. AMD also includes the set of methods that promote “executable” models (that is, where there is no explicit transformation to implementation).

AMG (access media gateways)

An access media gateway (AMG) serves as the bridge between a circuit-based voice switch and a packet-based IP or ATM access network. An AMG takes care of the PSTN-to-packet-network transition at the local-loop level and is connected to the local exchange or an access node. It has Class 5 switch interfaces and supports VoIP and/or VoATM.

Included in the AMG segment are inverse AMGs, which make the transition from the packet-access domain – DSL, cable hybrid fiber-coax, power line and local multipoint distribution service – to a PSTN Class 5 local exchange via Generic Requirement (GR)-303, V5.x interface and Primary Rate Interface (PRI) (Q.931) V5.2 access node (AN), and GR-303 remote digital terminal (RDT).

AMIA (American Medical Informatics Association)

A not-for-profit organization dedicated to the development and application of medical informatics in the support of patient care, teaching, research and healthcare administration. The AMIA serves as an authoritative body in the field of medical informatics and represents the United States in the informational arena of medical systems and informatics in international forums.

AMIS (Audio Messaging Interchange Specification)

An enhanced key system feature for voice/call processing that enables enterprise locations to transfer and forward voice messages between systems. It is a voice processing standard that specifies the procedures to network voice processing systems, regardless of who manufactures the system.

AMO (application management outsourcing)

The ongoing maintenance, management, conversion, enhancement and support of an application portfolio by an external company. AMO, a subset of application outsourcing (see separate entry), includes changes that generally take less than some predefined time to implement (e.g., 10 days or 30 days). Examples of maintenance include regulatory changes, software upgrades, new release installations and “fix it if it breaks” troubleshooting. AMO may involve the transfer of people and application software to the vendor.

AMOLED (active matrix organic light-emitting diode [OLED])

Display consisting of pixels of electroluminescent organic compounds “printed” in a matrix onto a flexible polymer layer, and which emits light of different colors. Unlike liquid crystal displays, OLED displays do not require a backlight and consume very little power, making them suitable for battery-powered devices. Active matrix OLEDs use a thin-film transistor (TFT) to control the pixels.

AMPS (advanced mobile phone service)

U.S.-originated analog cellular standard, now largely obsolete.

AMR (adaptive multirate)

GSM codec that lowers the codec rate in response to interference, affording a greater level of error correction and potentially enabling operators to reduce capital expenditures by reducing the number of cell sites needed to support the user base.

AMS (automation management system)

A subsystem of the warehouse management system. It controls automated material-handling equipment such as carousels, pick to light, in-line scales, and conveyors. The AMS is designed to provide a standardized interface between the warehouse management system and the automated material-handling equipment.

analog

Electronic transmission accomplished by adding signals of varying frequency or amplitude to carrier waves of a given frequency.

analog copiers

Image capture and transfer using optical or “light lens” technology in which the image is flash illuminated on the platen and transferred to the photoconductor through a series of lenses and mirrors. The latent image is then transferred from the photoconductor to paper through the electrophotographic process.

analytics

“analytic” application is defined as packaged BI capabilities for a particular domain or business problem.

analytics for CRM

These applications enable data preparation, data quality management, measurement and reporting, predictive modeling, profitability, and optimization.

andon

Visual control device from the Japanese word for “lantern,” implying an andon display that sheds light on current performance.

android

ANSI (American National Standards Institute)

ANSI coordinates the development and use of voluntary consensus standards in the U.S. and represents the needs and views of U.S. stakeholders in standardization global forums. ANSI is actively engaged in accrediting programs that assess conformance to standards.

antenna

Equipment used for transmitting or receiving radio waves/signals. In WLAN communication systems, in addition to transmitting and receiving signals, antennas may be used to focus signal energy to suit the installed environment. Common antenna types include: omnidirectional, which creates a spherical pattern; parabolic, which flattens the spherical pattern of the omnidirectional pattern and creates a larger circular coverage area; patch, which creates a semicircular pattern; and yagi, which narrows the antenna energy into a tubular pattern that is often used in long aisles, where coverage is needed. In satellite-based communication systems, the antenna usually consists of a parabolic reflector or dish and a feed horn. In a receiving system, the reflector focuses radio waves onto the feed horn for detection and conversion into electrical signals that are then are transmitted to an end-user device such as a PC or a TV, via a satellite modem/receiver. In transmitting systems, the reflector concentrates the radio waves or signals emitted by the feed horn into a narrow beam aimed back up toward the satellite. See also satellite dish.

AOA (angle of arrival)

Technology for determining the location of a cellular mobile phone. AOA requires a complex and expensive antenna array at each base station to determine the angle from which a cellular signal comes. It works best when detecting voice transmissions. See also location-based services (LBS).

AP (access point)

Pico base station or network access point in a WLAN radio network, consisting of a radio (often more than one) and a network connection, enabling WLAN clients to access network resources connected to a home or enterprise network.

applet

A small program that runs within an application. Applets are commonly used to make otherwise static Web pages more interactive. Examples include animated graphics, games, configurable bar charts and scrolling messages. Applets also play an important role in network computers (NCs). They increase an NC’s independence from the server because they do not have to communicate with the operating system (resident on the server) to function once the applet has been received by the NC.

appliance

An appliance is a preconfigured bundle of hardware and software integrated at the factory, created for a specific purpose, and typically packaged with services at time of sell.

application development

The AD software market comprises tools that represent each phase of the software development life cycle (application life cycle management [ALM], design, construction, automated software quality and other AD software).

application infrastructure suites

Because the market has evolved, products that were previously referred to as integration suites within this segment are now included with ESB suites. The application infrastructure suite market now includes only application platform suite functionality. Application platform suites are products composed of portals, integration middleware, BPM and business component engineering. They are geared toward supporting a variety of different project styles, including composite applications, new SOA applications and process integration.

application integration

The process of 1) keeping redundant copies of data (in independently designed applications) consistent, or 2) enabling end-users to access data and functionality from independently designed applications on a single user interface.

application management

Application management provides a wide variety of application services, processes and methodologies for maintaining, enhancing and managing custom applications, packaged software applications or network-delivered applications.

application portfolio analysis

A tool to divide current and proposed applications into three categories – utility, enhancement and frontier – based on the degree to which they contribute to the enterprise’s performance. The utility category is essential but does not enhance the enterprise’s performance (e.g., payroll); the enhancement category contains applications that improve the enterprise’s performance based on the use of established technology (e.g., documentation automation); and the frontier category is aimed at greatly improving enterprise performance (e.g., through aggressive use of rules-based decision support) but usually entails substantial risk. The management issues for each category are, respectively, cost, opportunity identification and innovation. The planning process should consider the best balance among the three categories to gain optimal future performance and the appropriate value from the application of IT.

application program

Software programs in a system are either application programs or supervisory programs, also called system software. Application programs contain instructions that transfer control to the system software to perform input/output and other routine operations, working through the application programming interface (API).

application server

An application server is a modern form of platform middleware. It is system software that resides between the operating system (OS) on one side, the external resources (such as a database management system [DBMS], communications and Internet services) on another side and the users’ applications on the third side. The function of the application server is to act as host (or container) for the user’s business logic while facilitating access to and performance of the business application. The application server must perform despite the variable and competing traffic of client requests, hardware and software failures, the distributed nature of the larger-scale applications, and potential heterogeneity of data and processing resources required to fulfill the business requirements of the applications.

A high-end online-transaction-processing-style application server delivers business applications with guaranteed levels of performance, availability and integrity. An application server also supports multiple application design patterns, according to the nature of the business application and the practices in the particular industry for which the application has been designed. It typically supports multiple programming languages and deployment platforms, although most have a particular affinity to one or two of these. Some application servers that implement standard application interfaces and protocols, such as Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE), are entirely proprietary. At present, the proprietary application servers are typically built into OSs, packaged applications, such as portals and e-commerce solutions, or other products and are not offered as stand-alone products. Proprietary and Java EE-compliant application servers are estimated in our Market Share and Forecast reports.

As the application server market matures, high performance becomes a stronger criterion, and thus where vendors now incorporate extensions to application servers, such as extreme transaction processing and event-based processing capabilities, these are also included in this market segment.

application sharing

The ability of two or more participants to have equal and simultaneous control over the content of a document inside an application (e.g., a word processing document, spreadsheet or conference slide) over a wide-area network, local-area network or modem connection. Enables users in different locations to work together on the same documents, with shared control and editing capabilities. A component of data conferencing.

application software services

This segment includes back-office, ERP and supply chain management (SCM) software services, as well as collaborative and personal software services. It also covers engineering software and front-office CRM software services.

• ERP and SCM software services – ERP is an application strategy focused on several distinct enterprise application suite markets. ERP is typically referred to as a back-office application set, but ERP applications typically automate and support more than administrative processes and include the support of production and inventory processes, as well as the asset management aspects of an enterprise SCM is a business strategy to improve shareholder and customer value by optimizing the flow of products, services and related information from source to customer. SCM encompasses the processes of creating and fulfilling the market’s demand for goods and services. It is a set of business processes that encompasses a trading partner community engaged in a common goal of satisfying the end customer. Thus, a supply chain process can stretch from a supplier’s supplier to a customer’s customer.
• Content, communications, and collaboration software services – The content, communications and collaboration software market sector comprises software products, tools and hosted services to organize, access, use and share content. Content management and/or collaboration initiatives involve managing and iages, forms and, increasingly, digital media. Included in this market sector are enterprise content management (ECM), e-mail and calendaring, Web conferencing and shared work spaces/team collaboration, IM, e-learning suites, information access with search, and ECM systems.
• Other applications software services – Other applications software includes, but is not limited to: commerce applications; e-discovery; e-learning; engineering applications; enterprise search; enterprise social software; geographic information systems; governance, risk and compliance; media and entertainment; mobile and wireless applications; and product life cycle management.
• CRM software services – CRM technologies should enable greater customer insight, increased customer access, more effective customer interactions, and integration throughout all customer channels and back-office enterprise functions. CRM is a business strategy, the outcome of which optimizes profitability, revenue and customer satisfaction by organizing around customer segments, fostering customer satisfying behaviors and implementing customer-centric processes. The CRM software sector, part of the enterprise software market, provides functionality to enterprises in three segments: sales, marketing, and customer service and support.
• Office suite software services – Office suites are software packages that bundle office or business management applications that include word processing, spreadsheets and presentation graphics. Other forms of office suites that are not included in this market definition are database tools, graphics suite, e-mail and calendaring, shared work space and team collaboration tools, and social software offerings that may have content authoring capabilities.

applications outsourcing

An outsourcing arrangement for a wide variety of application services including new development, legacy systems maintenance, offshore programming, management of packaged applications and staff augmentation. While this form of outsourcing generally involves a transfer of staff, the use of the term has recently broadened to include arrangements where this is not the case, as in staff augmentation. It does not include systems integration activities.

App Store

Apple’s download service for iTunes mobile applications, developed using the iPhone software development kit (SDK) for the iPhone and iPod touch. Generically the term has come to refer to a variety of mobile application services, including Android Market, Ovi Store, Windows Marketplace for Mobile and BlackBerry App World.

A standard table of seven-bit designations for digital representation of uppercase and lowercase Roman letters, numbers and special control characters in teletype, computer and word processor systems. Some IBM systems use similar code called Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC). Since most computer systems use a full byte to send an ASCII character, many hardware and software companies have made their own nonstandard and mutually incompatible extensions of the official ASCII 128-character set into a 256-character set.

ASD (automated supply dispensing)

An extension of supply chain management capabilities to automated and monitored dispensing of tangible supplies.

ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)

ASN (advanced shipment notice)

An electronic data interchange (EDI) message sent from the shipper to the receiver prior to the departure of the shipment from the shipper’s facility. The message includes complete information about the shipment and its contents. In today’s environment, this message is more often an “as shipped notice” sent after the departure of the shipment.

ASN (autonomous system number)

A number assigned to a local network, registered into the carrier’s routing community and placed under the umbrella of an administrative domain called an autonomous system (see AS).

ASO (automated system operations)

ASP (application service provider)

An enterprise that delivers application functionality and associated services across a network to multiple customers using a rental or usage-based transaction-pricing model. ASP market is defined as the delivery of standardized application software via a network, though not particularly or exclusively the Internet, through an outsourcing contract predicated on usage-based transaction pricing. The ASP market is composed of a mix of service providers (Web hosting and IT outsourcing), independent software vendors and network/telecommunications providers.

ASP (average selling price)

Typical “street” price of any product. In communications research, it generally refers to the typical price of a mobile phone.

asset management

This category includes products that provide one or all of the following: asset discovery; asset management; an asset database/repository; asset portfolio management; and tracking of purchases, leases, contracts and disposal pertaining to IT assets, including hardware and software. Links to general ledger accounting system modules, such as the capital asset ledger, are common. Integration with capacity products, user administration products, and order entry and e-procurement is desirable. When paired with an IT service desk (ITSD), asset management can become part of a complete solution for the business management of an IT department or IT outsourcer.

associativity

The ability to link computer-aided design (CAD) data and models together in a manner that allows design changes to be reflected automatically. Unidirectional or downstream associativity permits model changes to automatically change downstream data such as drafting, analysis or computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) data. Bidirectional associativity allows downstream changes, such as in drawings, to change the model.

ASSP (application-specific standard product)

ASTN (Automatic Switched Transport Network)

asynchronous

Characterized by not having a constant time interval between successive bits, characters or events. Transmission generally uses one start and one stop bit for character element synchronization (often called start-stop transmission).

asynchronous transmission

A process in which each information character, and sometimes each word or small block, is individually synchronized, usually by the use of start and stop elements.

ATC (ancillary terrestrial component)

Refers to the terrestrial ground segment of a hybrid satellite-terrestrial wireless network where the Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) network and the ATC terrestrial network share the same MSS frequencies to communicate with end-user equipment. A hybrid satellite-terrestrial wireless network (MSS/ATC hybrid network) comprises one or more multispot beam satellites (space segments) and a nationwide network of terrestrial cell sites (the ATC) — as yet to be built. The space segment contains a satellite system that employs high-powered antennas, a large number of spot beams, and advanced frequency reuse technology to communicate with user devices on the ground. These dual-mode satellite/terrestrial wireless devices will likely be similar to current cellular/mobile user equipment and will enable a seamless user experience — moving from satellite to terrestrial operation — in a manner similar to traditional terrestrial cell-to-cell operation. Globalstar, MSV, TerreStar, ICO and Inmarsat are among the international mobile satellite operators vying to develop hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks using ATC ground segments. See also space segment, ground segment, MSS, spot beams and frequency reuse.

ATG (advanced technology group)

The role of the ATG is to provide a continuing stream of technology opportunities to the enterprise. It typically takes the lead in prototype and pilot projects.

ATM (Adobe Type Manager)

A program that enables the user to view type of any size with the highest resolution the user’s monitor can provide.

ATM (asynchronous transfer mode)

A wide-area network (WAN) technology, a transfer mode for switching and transmission that efficiently and flexibly organizes information into cells; it is asynchronous in the sense that the recurrence of cells depends on the required or instantaneous bit rate. Thus, empty cells do not go by when data is waiting. ATM’s powerful flexibility lies in its ability to provide a high-capacity, low-latency switching fabric for all types of information, including data, video, image and voice, that is protocol-, speed- and distance-independent. ATM supports fixed-length cells 53 bytes in length and virtual data circuits between 45 megabits per second (Mbps) and 622 Mbps. Using statistical multiplexing, cells from many different sources are multiplexed onto a single physical circuit. The fixed-length fields in the cell, which include routing information used by the network, ensure that faster processing speeds are enabled using simple hardware circuits. The greatest benefit of ATM is its ability to provide support for a wide range of communications services while providing transport independence from those services.

ATM (automated teller machine)

A public banking machine that is usually hooked up to a central computer through leased local lines and a multiplexed data network.

ATO (assemble to order)

A strategy allowing a product or service to be made to specific order, where a large number of products can be assembled in various forms from common components. This requires sophisticated planning processes to anticipate changing demand for internal components or accessories while focusing on mass customization of the final products to individual customers.

attenuation

A decrease in the magnitude of the current, voltage or power of a signal in transmission between points because of the transmission medium. Attenuation is usually expressed in decibels.

$AttrDef

This metadata file contains the definitions of all the attributes that are allowed on an NTFS volume.

Attribute

on disk a file is stored as a set of attributes resident / non res

$ATTRIBUTE_LIST

This attribute is used when a file’s attributes won’t fit in a single MFT File Record. It has a list of all the attributes and where they can be found. The $ATTRIBUTE_LIST is always stored in the Base FILE Record.

See also: File Record $MFT Base FILE Record

Audit, Auditing

As part of the security permissions of a file, any actions performed on the file can be recorded. For example a file could be required to log all the people who tried to read it, but didn’t have the permissions to do so.

AUI (autonomous unit interface or attachment unit interface)

Most commonly used in reference to the 15-pin D-type connector and cables used to connect single- and multiple-channel equipment to an Ethernet transceiver.

authentication

The use of passwords, tokens (such as smart cards), digital certificates or biometrics (more commonly fingerprint, hand geometry and voice biometrics) to verify the identity of a user and better ensure against fraud.

authentication service

A mechanism, analogous to the use of passwords on time-sharing systems, for the secure authentication of the identity of network clients by servers and vice versa, without presuming the operating system integrity of either (e.g., Kerberos).

authorization

A process ensuring that correctly authenticated users can access only those resources for which the owner has given them approval.

automated backup

Delivers the most basic form of storage availability — recoverable data. Most enterprises are struggling with the implementation of this function. It is a conceptually complex and labor-intensive process. Backup design must address multiple elements (e.g., hardware, network, file system and application) across heterogeneous platforms and geographically dispersed sites. Labor intensive, departmental processes are replaced with automated, enterprise-level solutions to increase availability.

automated testing and quality management (distributed and mainframe)

Automated testing applies to commercially or internally developed software or services to assist in the testing process, including functional and load/stress testing. Automated tests provide consistent results and data points. The benefits are ease of maintenance, the ability to efficiently use resources in off-peak hours, and the capability to create reports based on the executed tests. Quality management tools include functionality for test planning, test case management and defect management (the governance piece of quality).

automatic error correction

A transmission system feature that automatically detects and corrects a proportion of errors in a received signal. It performs fault detection and isolation and reconfigures the system, dynamically invoking redundant components without the need to bring the system down.

automatic message-switching center

In a communications network, the location at which data is automatically routed according to its destination.

automatic restart

Also known as “warm recovery,” this is the resumption of operation after a system failure with minimal loss of work or processes (as opposed to a “cold” restart, which requires a complete reload of the system with no processes surviving).

autonomation

Mechanism to implement the Japanese term jidoka, or automation with the human touch. It is the execution of the principle where a human can stop a production process if there is a quality issue.

autosensing

Automatic adjustment to differing operating conditions or to transmission type or speed.

autotopology

A feature of network management systems that automates the creation of a graphical network configuration map.

autovectorizing

Software used in technical document control systems to convert certain bitmapped data to geometrical values.

availability

The assurance that an enterprise’s IT infrastructure has suitable recoverability and protection from system failures, natural disasters or malicious attacks.

availability and performance

These tools are software products, including enterprisewide consoles, that are used to monitor and manage the performance and availability of systems, networks (and increasingly storage) mainly beneath the DBMS and application layers. (Management of databases, applications and networks is covered in separate categories with those names.)

The service management category was merged with availability and performance because performance products and service management products were becoming indistinguishable. Performance (and service management) products provide a service-level view and analysis of end-to-end performance (and often of availability). These products are evolving toward a business activity view of the IT and Web infrastructure (BAM). This logical, higher-level management layer will focus on the quality-of-service and service-guarantee issues linked with underlying more-granular network, system, Web and application management. Performance (service) software is sometimes used in-house or is outsourced from a third-party provider, such as a telecommunications carrier or Web hoster.

Performance tools focus on comparing the expected quality of resource availability for a resource or “service” with actual results. The tools use historical data and include features such as baselining, trend analysis, historical usage analysis, service-level reporting, and, in some cases, interfaces to chargeback and billing systems. Included here are service-level agreement tools and customer response time measurement tools. Tools for internal chargeback and capacity planning, as well as tools that design an internetwork, are in this segment. Performance monitoring and analysis products are also included here.

avatar

Computer representation of users in a computer-generated 3-D world, used primarily in chat and entertainment Web sites. Potential business applications include customer support, training or sales, where avatars in an enterprise’s Web site may assist potential customers through text or audio links.

AVD circuits (alternate voice/data circuits)

Circuits that have been conditioned to handle both voice and data traffic.

average ARPU (monthly)

This includes all IPTV-related revenue paid by the consumer directly to the IPTV service provider, averaged monthly over the year. These revenues can be in the form of subscriptions and/or pay per use charges, such as VOD fees.

average inventory

In an inventory system, this is the sum of one-half the lot sizes plus the reserve stock in formula calculations.

AVS (address verification service)

A fraud detection method in which the address provided by the buyer at the time of purchase is matched against the address registered with the card issuer. The result of this check (match/mismatch) is sent back to the merchant, but a mismatch does not result in automatic transaction denial. Since there are valid reasons for a mismatch, merchants are left to consider a variety of factors (e.g., size of the transaction) to determine whether to accept the purchase.

AWP (average wholesale price)

Sum of the factory gate price and shipment costs to the top tier of the distribution channel.

B

B+ Tree

A B+ tree is a variant of the binary tree. Instead of one data element per node, there are many. (In NTFS the actual number depends on the lengths of the names and the cluster size). The B+ tree retains the efficiency of a binary tree and also performs well with large numbers of data elements (because the tree tends to grow wide rather than deep).

See also: Binary Tree and Balanced Tree.

B2B services (integration as a service)

B2B integration capabilities that are hosted in a multitenant environment were traditionally known as “EDI value-added networks (VANs)”; we now call these hosted offerings “integration as a service.” Vendors referred to their integration-as-a-service offerings with a range of labels, including EDI VANs, integration platforms, EDI software as a service (SaaS), EDI services, Web services networks, transaction delivery networks, hosted integration services, business process networks, integration service providers and on-demand EDI. To be considered as an integration service provider, a vendor must offer hosted multienterprise integration and interoperability services. These include some combination of:

• Communications services (including multiprotocol support for protocols such as EDI, AS2, RosettaNet and Web services)
• Trading partner management services (such as tools to provision connections and manage certificates for security)
• Integration services (such as in-line translation and back-end system integration)
• Application services (such as order visibility or compliance management)

We do not include B2B project outsourcing – another form of B2B services – within this market because this is regarded as an IT professional services offering.

BAAD

During chkdsk, if NTFS finds a multi-sector item (MFT, INDEX BLOCK, etc) where the multi-sector header doesn’t match the values at the end of the sector, it marks the item with the magic number ‘BAAD’, and fill it with zeroes (except for a short at the end of each sector…)

FIXME

“BAAD” == corrupt record

“CHKD” == chkdsk ???

“FILE” == mft entry

“HOLE” == ??? (NTFS 3.0+?)

“INDX” == index buffer

RSTR & ???

See also: chkdsk and fsck.

The server side of a client/server system.

background task

A task performed by a system during the time when its primary application is idle.

backhaul

The terrestrial link between an earth station and a switching or data center.

back-off algorithm

The formula used to determine when a second attempt will be made to access a network after an initial failed access attempt.

backplane

The physical connection between the interface cards and the data and power distribution buses in a network device such as a router, hub or switch.

backup and recovery software

Backup and recovery software products are designed to provide backup of storage to tape, disk or optical devices and to recover that data when needed. This segment also includes products focused specifically on supporting the recovery process, such as virtual tape libraries. Also included are media management, deduplication and backup reporting products, as well as archiving products that are included with the backup application. Media management activities include allocating, labeling, tracking, recycling and monitoring media, as well as storage pool management.

backup server

A software or hardware system that copies or “shadows” the contents of a server, providing redundancy.

$Bad

This is the named Data Stream representing bad clusters on a volume.

See also: $BadClus.

$BadClus

This metadata file lists all the unreadable clusters on the volume.

balanced scorecard

A performance measurement and management approach that recognizes that financial measures by themselves are not sufficient and that an enterprise needs a more holistic, balanced set of measures which reflects the different drivers that contribute to superior performance and the achievement of the enterprise’s strategic goals. The balanced scorecard is driven by the premise that there is a cause-and-effect link between learning, internal efficiencies and business processes, customers, and financial results.

Balanced Tree

Often binary trees can become very uneven. By reorganising the data, the tree can be balanced such that no a node has similar numbers of children to it’s left and right.

See also: B+ Tree and Binary Tree.

BAM (business activity monitoring)

BAM is neither a market nor a product. It is a concept, such as quality or knowledge management, and it is not new. BAM solutions focus on cross-business processes rather than on divisional-, departmental- or technology-specific processes. The scope of integration in BAM solutions expands far beyond the four walls of a plant or a division, and real time is not necessarily nanoseconds, but rather it is determined by the requirements of the business process. It brings the near-real-time world of the BI operational data store together with IT operations monitoring and BPM through integration brokers and shared messaging.

band

The range of frequencies between two defined limits.
In wide-area telephone service (WATS), the specific geographical area in which the customer is entitled to call.

bandpass filter

A circuit designed to allow a single band of frequencies to pass.

bandwidth

The range of frequencies that can pass over a given transmission channel. The bandwidth determines the rate at which information can be transmitted through the circuit: the greater the bandwidth, the more information that can be sent in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in bits per second. Increasing bandwidth potential has become a high priority for network planners due to the growth of multimedia, including videoconferencing, and the increased use of the Internet.
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a modulated signal is tested within a range of frequencies on either side of the carrier frequency. This range is also called a bandwidth. In the case of videodiscs, it is often 15 kilohertz (KHz) on either side.

bank tier

• Tier 1 includes between 20 and 25 global bank assets and/or capital markets price makers with daily trading volume exceeding 50,000 transactions. These banks want software using open architecture on a framework on which they can leverage tools, such as analytics.
• Tier 2 constitutes about 200 international and national banks and/or capital markets price takers, as well as trading volume averaging about 30,000 transactions daily. Such banks seek new technology with a complete vertical integration of functions. Cross-asset functionality is not a concern, except for structuring deals because of the specialized focus of their trading businesses. They desire analytics and a front- to back-office suite to improve transparency and risk management.
• Tier 3 consists of approximately 1,000 banks, including smaller national and regional banks, and capital markets price takers. These banks want cross-asset platforms, but don’t have the requisite IT resources in-house and must rely on vendors. Their biggest concern is implementation risk.
• Tier 4 comprises smaller regional institutions with a primary focus on core banking and limited capital markets trading. Such firms often source their capital markets requirements through third parties and tend to use an ASP approach.

BAPI (Business Application Programming Interface)

A set of documented, server-side interfaces to one or more R/3 processes, from SAP. BAPI packages multiple internal functions to enable programmatic access to such higher-order tasks as checking customer numbers, providing product descriptions, selecting products, creating quotations or creating orders.

baseband

Transmitting a signal in its original, unmodulated form. A baseband signal can be analog (e.g., originating from a telephone) or digital (e.g., originating from a computer).

Base FILE Record

If the attributes don’t fit into a single MFT record then the Base FILE Record holds enough information to locate the other records.

See also: $ATTRIBUTE_LIST, FILE Record and $MFT.

base station

Within a mobile radio system, a fixed radio station providing communication with mobile stations and, where applicable, with other base stations and the public telephone network.

batch processing

The processing of application programs and their data individually, with one being completed before the next is started. It is a planned processing procedure typically used for purposes such as preparing payrolls and maintaining inventory records.

baud

A unit of signaling speed. The speed in bauds is the number of discrete changes per second in some aspect of a signal (e.g., voltage in a wire). Transmission speeds are now more commonly measured bits per second (bps), rather than bauds. The two terms were roughly synonymous until modems began to exceed 2,400 bps, after which they diverged more widely as modem speed has increased. Modems now use coding techniques to transmit more than one bit per baud, making their true baud ratings irrelevant.

BCC (block check character)

A control character appended to blocks in character-oriented protocols. Used for determining if the block was received in error in longitudinal and cyclic redundancy checking.

BCD (binary-coded decimal)

A numeric notation in which each of decimal digit is represented by a binary numeral. For example, in BCD notation, the number 23 is represented as “0010 0011” (as compared to the representation “10111” in the pure binary numeration system.

benchmarking

The comparison between vendor performance and designated benchmark organizations or indexes. An index is a publicly available indicator for a factor that is associated with a pricing element.

• Internal benchmarking is the continuous process of measuring a company’s products, services and practices to determine whether the best possible job is performed with the resources at hand. This can include comparing similar functions of different operating units in an organization or comparing the operations of a specific division from one year to the next.
• External benchmarking is the continuous process of measuring a company’s products, services and practices and comparing them with those of another company. This can include comparisons with industry peers, functional leaders, or best-in-class performers.

bend loss

Attenuation in fiber cabling resulting from a bend being at too great an angle or from distortion within the cable.

bend radius

The radius of the smallest circle possible when bending a cable, if transmission is not to be faulty.

best-in-class

The superior product within a category of hardware or software. It does not necessarily mean best product overall, however. For example, the best-in-class product in a low-priced category may be inferior to the best product on the market, which could sell for much more. See best-of-breed.

best-of-breed

The best product of its type. Enterprises often purchase software from different vendors to obtain the best-of-breed offering for each application area. For example, enterprises may purchase a human-resource package from one vendor and an accounting package from another. Although enterprise resource planning (ERP) vendors offer numerous enterprise applications and claim that their integrated system is a superior solution, all modules in an ERP system are rarely best-of-breed. See best-in-class.

best practice

A group of tasks that optimizes the efficiency (cost and risk) or effectiveness (service level) of the business discipline or process to which it contributes. It must be implementable, replicable, transferable and adaptable across industries.

beta test

The stage at which a new product is tested under actual usage conditions.

BI (business intelligence)

BIA (business impact analysis)

BIA identifies the cost (financial and nonfinancial) of a set of business processes that are not functioning correctly. It is one of the early steps required for preparing a disaster recovery plan (DRP) or a business continuity plan (BCP). Without this step, it is difficult for the business continuity manager to balance the cost of the DRP or BCP against the potential loss.

BICC (business intelligence competency center)

A business intelligence competency center (BICC) develops the overall strategic plan and priorities for BI. It also defines requirements, such as data quality and governance and fulfills the role of promoting the use of BI.

bid

An attempt to gain control over a line in order to transmit data, usually associated with the contention style of sharing a single line among several terminals.
A vendor’s proposal to win a contract.

BI IDA (business intelligence information delivery architecture)

A key element of business intelligence (BI) implementation planning deals with the means and mechanisms for providing the needed data and information to users. Information delivery via desktop databases, intermediate servers, client/server database applications, or Web server interaction presents a challenge to most enterprises and many users. The BI IDA provides a framework and implementation model for evaluating and prioritizing users’ needs as well as matching those needs to the evolving delivery approaches and technologies.

bill-of-material processor

Computer applications supplied by many manufacturers for maintaining, updating and retrieving bill-of-material information on direct-access files.

binary code

Maths carried out in base two. In this documentation, certain flags fields are represented in binary, for the sake of clarity. e.g. 000010002, 0100000002.

See also: Decimal, Hex and Units.

Binary Tree

This is an efficient way of storing sorted data in order. Each node in the tree represents a data element. The left child node is a collection of all the elements that come before it. The right child node is a collection of all the elements that come after it.

See also: B+ Tree and Balanced Tree.

bindery

A database used by a workstation or network operating system to store internal data such as user or node definitions.

biometric authentication

A form of user authentication based on a physical (e.g., fingerprint, iris, face or hand) or behavioral (e.g., signature or voice) characteristic. Because it is based on something the person “is,” biometric authentication can provide a higher level of security that something a person “knows” (e.g., password, PIN or mother’s maiden name) or something a person “has” (e.g., a card, key or hardware token). Biometrics can be used to verify a person’s claimed identity or to identify a user from a database of candidates. To use a biometric system, the user must enroll by providing several samples of the biometric, from which the system creates a template for that user. At the time of verification or authentication, the live sample of the biometric is compared against the stored template.

biometrics

A biometric characteristic, or a biometric trait, is a measurable physiological or behavioral trait of a living person, especially one that can be used to determine or verify the identity of a person in access control or criminal forensics. Most real adoption of biometric technologies during the next five years will come from government applications (for example, immigration, social security and surveillance), although corporate adoption will continue to grow slowly until biometric readers are routinely embedded in hardware, such as notebooks. Typical biometric measures include fingerprints, retinal recognition, facial thermograms and voice recognition.

BIOS (basic input/output system)

The part of an operating system that links the specific hardware devices to the software. It obtains the buffers required to send information from a program to the hardware/desktop receiving the information.

BI platforms

BI platforms provide the infrastructure and tools to enable users to build applications that facilitate decision making and help organizations learn, understand and improve their business. A BI platform is defined as a software platform that delivers most of the following capabilities under three overarching categories of functionality:

• Integration (BI infrastructure, metadata management, development, and workflow and collaboration)
• Information delivery (reporting, dashboards, ad hoc query and Microsoft Office integration)
• Analysis (online analytical processing [OLAP], advanced visualization, predictive modeling and data mining, and scorecards)

Please note that for software to be qualified as a BI platform, it must fill a majority of the criteria above. For example, we do not consider a stand-alone solution of integration, metadata and collaboration to be a BI platform.

B-ISDN (Broadband ISDN)

A high-speed (greater than ISDN primary rate), asynchronous, time division multiplexed transmission facility, or an arrangement of such facilities, designed to provide a wide range of audio, video and data applications in the same network.

blanking interval

The area in a video signal that falls between frames. It is often used to accommodate data such as synchronizing information.

blended premises/services approach

This type of solution tightly integrates on-premises and service offerings, and has its roots in a range of network-based service solutions. Service offerings, until now, have largely remained as un-unified, stand-alone communications services, or as all-in-one bundles that lack critical enterprise functions. Fully featured and integrated on-premises service UC solutions are only beginning to enter the market.

BLERT (block error rate test)

A test conducted by transmitting a known blocked bit pattern, comparing the pattern received with the pattern transmitted, and counting the number of blocks containing errored bits.

BLOB (binary large object)

A generic term used to describe the handling and storage of long strings of data by database management systems. A BLOB is a category of data , characterized by large size (including media formats such as audio and video), which can place extreme demands on storage systems and network bandwidth.

block

A group of bits or bytes treated as a unit. In Linux terminology, this is a cluster. Block device In Linux terminology, this is a storage unit. Cluster The minimum allocation unit. Clusters are a fixed power of 2 of the sector size (called the cluster factor), and their size can be between 512 bytes and 4 KB (Sometimes 64 KB, but 4 KB is the largest cluster size that the current NTFS compression engine can operate with. That limit may be related to the 4 KB page size used on the Intel i386 CPU). This size can be set with the Windows NT format utility, whose default is: Volume size Cluster size 1 to 512 MB Sector size 512 MB to 1 GB 1 KB 1 GB to 2 GB 2 KB more than 2 GB 4 KB

block down conversion

The conversion of a full satellite band to a lower frequency (e.g., from SHF to UHF or VHF).

In data communications testing, the ratio between the total number of blocks transmitted in a given message and the number of blocks in that message received in error; a measure of the quality of a data transmission.

blocking

The inability to connect two lines in a network because all possible paths between them are already in use.

Bluetooth

Low-power wireless networking technology operating in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. There are two classes of Bluetooth device – Class 1 devices have higher output power and a range of about 100 meters, and Class 2 devices have lower power and a range of about 10 meters. Bluetooth enables ad hoc networking of up to eight devices (supporting voice and data). The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) was founded in 1998 by IBM, Intel, Ericsson, Nokia and Toshiba, and is supported by more than 2,500 organizations. The Bluetooth v.1.0 specification was ratified and published in 1999 and supported data rates of up to 1Mbps. Bluetooth Version 2.1, along with its enhanced data rate (EDR) specification, was ratified in March 2007, supporting data rates of up to 3Mbps, and simplified “pairing” – the process used for securely linking one Bluetooth device to another. It also reduced power consumption, doubling the battery life of headsets and other mobile devices for which the Bluetooth radio consumes a large percentage of the power budget. Version 3.0 (“Seattle”) was adopted by the SIG in April 2009, and the specification included Wi-Fi as an alternative transport layer for large volumes of data, supporting data rates of up to 24 Mbps. The SIG also adopted “Bluetooth low energy,” a new ultra-low-power variant, previously referred to as Ultra Low Power (ULP) Bluetooth and Wibree. See also ZigBee and ultrawideband (UWB).

Bluetooth LE (low energy)

Specification adopted by the Bluetooth SIG in April 2009 that enables low-power peripherals with a battery life of months to years to communicate with Bluetooth in handsets or other devices. Bluetooth LE opens up a new range of devices and applications such as on-body medical sensors and sports and fitness equipment. LE arose from a technology called Wibree (owned by Nokia) and was previously called ULP Bluetooth.

BMIT (business management of IT)

A framework developed to help managers focus on the key issues affecting each area or stage of an IT strategy and how these issues impact the business or organizational side of the enterprise.

bounce

The return of an undeliverable e-mail.

BPA (business process automation)

The automation of complex business processes and functions beyond conventional data manipulation and record-keeping activities, usually through the use of advanced technologies. It focuses on “run the business” as opposed to “count the business” types of automation efforts and often deals with event-driven, mission-critical, core processes. BPA usually supports an enterprise’s knowledge workers in satisfying the needs of its many constituencies.

BPA (business process analysis) tools

Business process analysis (BPA) tools are primarily intended for use by business end users looking to document, analyze and streamline complex processes, thereby improving productivity, increasing quality, and becoming more agile and effective. These tools also support the roles of business process architect and business process analyst, and enable them to better understand business processes, events, workflows and data using proven modeling techniques. BPA tools permit users to diagram their processes, noting (generally abstracted) rules or specifications to promote understanding, validate this information using standard methodologies and best practices enabled by the software, and ideally, automate the models into deployable applications that leverage their analytical efforts and comply with the business process rules. BPA tools feature the following functionality:

• Business model drawing and development
• Ease of use in operation, development and administration
• Business model analysis
• Integration and automation
• Multiuser support/versioning and extensibility
• Methodology and use
• Performance and scalability
• Vertical-industry and horizontal cross-industry template support

bpi (bits per inch)

A measurement used to calculate the number of bits stored in a linear inch of a track on a disk, tape or other recording surface.

BPM (business process management)

BPM (business process modeling)

A process that links business strategy to IT systems development to ensure business value. It combines process/workflow, functional, organizational and data/resource views with underlying metrics such as costs, cycle times and responsibilities to provide a foundation for analyzing value chains, activity-based costs, bottlenecks, critical paths and inefficiencies.

BPM pure-play software

The term “BPM pure play” describes tools that delivered an application-independent approach to coordinating business. BPM pure-play products provide a set of services and tools for explicit process management (that is, process analysis, definition, execution, monitoring and administration), including support for human- and application-level interaction. BPM pure-play software includes commercially available software products that have all these features:

• Process orchestration engine
• Modeling environment
• Human-to-human workflow
• Monitoring and analysis capabilities
• Offline simulation
• System-to-system integration
• Business process performance reporting

Only general-purpose, cross-industry BPM pure-play software is included in this category. There are many vertical-industry-specific BPM pure-play software products that are not covered here.

BPMS (business process management suite)

BPM is a technology-enabled discipline, which causes the confusion between the BPM discipline and BPM technologies. A number of technologies could be used for BPM, but BPMSs represent the most-evolved and comprehensive approach to BPM at present. A BPMS is a complete set of integrated composition technologies for managing all aspects of process – people, machines, information, business rules and policies supporting full process discovery, analysis, design, development, execution, monitoring and optimization cycle, in which business professionals and IT collaborate as peers. A BPMS makes the business process explicit (visible and independent of its implementation), using business process models. A BPMS makes these models executable; they are not just documentation.

A BPMS must include the following 10 component capabilities:

• Process execution and state management engine
• Model-driven development environment
• Document and content interaction
• User and group interaction
• Basic system connectivity
• Business events, BI and business activity monitoring (BAM) support
• Online and offline simulation and optimization
• Business rule management
• System management and administration
• Process component registry/repository

BPO (business process outsourcing)

BPO is defined as “the delegation of one or more IT-intensive business processes to an external provider that, in turn, owns, administrates and manages the selected processes based on defined and measurable performance metrics.” Examples of business processes that are outsourced to an ESP include logistics, procurement, HR, finance and accounting, CRM, or other administrative or customer-facing business functions.

BPR (business process re-engineering)

Business process re-engineering, where “as-is” and “to-be” process activities are defined and improvement generally takes the form of a complete redesign BPR analytical techniques

Mathematical, graphical, logical and managerial algorithms for describing and modeling business processes, information systems or management decision-making systems.

BPR methodology

bps (bits per second)

Measure of the capacity or throughput of a communication channel. The ability to achieve a particular bps depends on the bandwidth, frequency and modulation technique. See also bandwidth.

BR (business routing)

A category of call routing used for sales or service functions. The general objective is to determine, as transparently as possible, the caller’s needs, business value and relationship, and ultimately to automate the call’s routing to a resource. The process is usually driven by multiple databases, with each factor considered becoming a decision or value point.

brand and product management

These applications enable trade promotion, product development management and market research.

brand service company

Similar to the in-sourcing model, a company that is built to provide services to a large organization or a group of business-oriented companies. Services provided (which may include non-IT services and business processes) are carefully compared against the market, and the services company leverages external services providers (ESPs), selectively outsourcing part of their services.

BRE software

A BRE is a specific collection of design-time and runtime software that allows an enterprise to explicitly define, analyze, execute, audit and maintain a wide variety of business logic, collectively referred to as “rules.” A BRE allows IT and/or business staff to define rules using decision trees, decision tables, pseudo-natural language, programminglike code or other representation techniques. Unlike traditional AD approaches, a BRE isolates the rule representation from the executing business logic – providing for explicit rule management. A BRE provides features to analyze rules for rule conflicts, rule consistency and other quality issues. A BRE allows auditing of the rule execution path and firing order, and it provides a rule repository and related features to maintain and enhance the rule base. A BRE may simply provide rule externalization capabilities (separating rules from programming code), or it may provide higher-level rule-processing capabilities, such as inferencing (forward chaining, goal-directed backward chaining), case-based reasoning and advanced heuristics. Many BRE vendors are increasing their business rule management technologies and “ecosystems” and are creating comprehensive business rule management systems that add capabilities to the basic BRE technology.

Only general-purpose, cross-industry BRE software is included in this category. There are many vertical-industry-specific BRE software products that are not covered here.

break

An interruption to a transmission; frequently a provision permitting a controlled terminal to interrupt the controlling computer.

BREW (binary runtime environment for wireless)

Application ecosystem designed by Qualcomm to support application development, provisioning, marketing and billing of handheld wireless data applications, predominantly for consumers.

broadband

Channels carried on coaxial or fiber-optic cables that have a wider bandwidth than conventional telephone lines, giving them the ability to carry video, voice and data simultaneously. Cable modems and digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies are examples of broadband connectivity.

broadband access

The access function enables end users to connect to a network. It provides the initial customer interface and plays a critical role in determining the customer “experience.” The access part of a network tends to account for a large share of network investment because of customers’ diverse needs and locations, and the high cost of the customer premises equipment (CPE). It is also the most expensive part of the network from an operations perspective.

Broadband access includes the following fixed broadband access technologies:

• Fiber to the home (FTTH).
• Generic digital subscriber line (xDSL), including all DSL flavors (also the so-called fiber to the curb [FTTC] where the “last mile access” is still based on copper).
• Broadband wireless access including all WiMAX but excluding mobile broadband technologies covered under mobile infrastructure. (Mobile WiMAX will be a niche technology and is included in broadband access with the rest of WiMAX.)

broadband aggregation/IP services routers

These routers are a subset of edge routers. They are aggregation and termination systems that accept a high concentration of data traffic from multiple xDSL access multiplexers, cable modem termination systems, wireless headends, dial-access concentrators and routers. In addition to aggregation and termination, these systems offer the following subscriber management services:

• Differentiated classes of service, different priority levels for different classes of network user, dynamic selection and delivery of network services, QoS for data, voice and video applications, and user-based billing.

Security and random authentication, troubleshooting and remote diagnostics, network management, managed firewalls and secure VPNs.

Broadband aggregation system vendors and their products include:

• Cisco: 7200, 7300, 7600, 10000 Series.
• Juniper Networks: E-series.
• Redback Networks: SMS and SmartEdge families.

business consulting

Business consulting services are limited to business operations consulting services that typically preface, enable or influence the adoption of IT. These business consulting services include business process transformation, business process redesign or re-engineering, business performance improvement, corporate compliance, risk management, governance and sourcing advisory. These services may be sold or sourced as discrete projects, or as preludes to outsourcing engagements. Regardless of how they are sold and delivered, business consulting services will directly affect IT. This distinguishes them from other types of business consulting, such as strategy consulting or corporate finance that may sometimes influence IT.

business intelligence

Business intelligence (BI) is defined as the general ability to organize, access and analyze information in order to learn and understand the business. BI is an umbrella term that includes the applications, infrastructure and tools, and best practices that enable access to and analysis of information to improve and optimize decisions and performance…

business IP telephones segmentation

business process management (BPM)

Business process management (BPM) is defined as a management discipline that treats business processes as assets that directly improve enterprise performance by driving operational excellence and business agility…

business process outsourcing (BPO)

BPO is defined as “the delegation of one or more IT-intensive business processes to an external provider that, in turn, owns, administrates and manages the selected processes based on defined and measurable performance metrics.” Examples of business processes that are outsourced to an ESP include logistics, procurement, HR, finance and accounting, CRM, or other administrative or customer-facing business functions.

BPO services are characterized by multiyear, contractual relationships, with appropriate SLAs that deliver full business processes to the service recipient. Typically, BPO services include the delivery of the people and process workflows, as well as the underpinning technology that supports them. Additionally, gradients of process — and pieces of subprocesses — can be outsourced as discrete BPO contracts, or full end-to-end, comprehensive arrangements. In all cases, the inherent risk for the business process in scope is the responsibility of the service provider, as outlined in the contract’s statement of work. This is what differentiates BPO from, for example, application outsourcing.

At the core of BPO forecasts are process management services, but other product support, consulting, and development/integration services can also be delivered through BPO contracts. This is because the typical life cycle of a BPO contract will follow design-build-and-run phases, during which consulting, implementation and management services are being delivered. That said, the cornerstone of any BPO deal is the process management revenue, which represents the ongoing, steady-state phase of the deal, once the processes are fully transitioned to the service provider.

CAC (connection admission control)

A function in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks that checks whether network resources are available to support the quality of service and traffic parameters of an incoming connection. Also known as “call admission control.”

CAC (context-aware computing)

Context-aware computing (CAC) centers around the concept of leveraging information about the end user to improve the quality of the interaction with the end user. The term “context-enriched services” describes software that uses information about an end user’s environment, community, process and identity to enrich a core function. These services are one of CAC’s fundamental building blocks. Enterprises can leverage CAC to better target prospects, increase customer intimacy, and enhance associate productivity and collaboration.

cache

A temporary storage area for instructions and data near a computer’s central processing unit (CPU), usually implemented in high-speed memory. It replicates information from main memory or storage in a way that facilitates quicker access, using fewer resources than the original source. Because data is closer to the CPU, it can be retrieved more quickly.

caching server

A device that efficiently stores frequently requested data from protocols such as Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and has the ability to “prefetch” additional data at preset intervals. A network caching server has the ability to listen on the network and intercept protocol requests on its associated Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports. This alleviates the need to have the enterprise’s browser configured to “know” where the server sits on the network.

Major improvements have been in the architecture, mechanical, electronic and electrical-engineering disciplines.

CAGR (compound annual growth rate)

The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the annualized average rate of revenue growth between two given years, assuming growth takes place at an exponentially compounded rate. The CAGR between given years X and Z, where Z – X = N, is the number of years between the two given years, is calculated as follows:

CAGR, year X to year Z = [(value in year Z/value in year X) ^ (1/N)-1]

For example, the CAGR for 2006 to 2011 is calculated as:

CAGR, 2006 to 2011 (X = 2006, Z = 2011, N = 5) = [(value in 2011/value in 2006) ^ (1/5)-1]

A group or department where employees receive and make high volumes of telephone calls. Call centers can have internal customers (e.g., help desks) or external customers (e.g., customer service and support centers). The call center uses a variety of technologies to improve the management and servicing of the call (see call center suite). A center that use both phone- and non-phone-based communication channels (e.g., e-mail or the Web) is known as a “contact center” (see separate entry).

call center suite

A product that offers a suite of integrated components to support a call center (e.g., a help desk or a customer service and support center). In the past, integrating these components often required the services of an independent integrator; however, as call center functions move to open software platforms, many vendors now offer bundled suites of call center functionality.

An all-in-one call center suite provides a complete set of call center functions as a single platform, within the control of a single administrative view. Components include:

• An open computing platform (usually Windows NT or Unix)
• Telephone switch functionality and computer-telephony integration (CTI)
• Intelligent routing, based on business rules or agent skills
• Automatic call distribution (ACD), interactive voice response (IVR) and voice mail functions
• Outbound (e.g., predictive) dialing
• Application integration interfaces and tools
• “Cradle to grave” contact reporting, and component administration

A multifunction call center suite differs from an all-in-one suite in that it does not require switching integration. Instead, the switch functionality can be on a separate platform, controlled via CTI links and administered separately.

caller ID

A telephone service that records the telephone numbers of incoming calls; it is a form of automatic number identification (ANI). Caller ID systems can be integrated with customer databases to streamline call management processes. This integration gives the agent receiving a call instantaneous access to relevant information about the caller. For example, when a customer calls, that customer’s name immediately appears on the agent’s computer screen. The screen might include information about the product a customer purchased and the purchase date. The system could also display the client’s previous call history, information about other products the customer owns and price promotions on products that might also be appealing to that caller, based on a profile in the database.

call information logging

Seven elements comprise the technological foundation of the CAPE system architecture:

• Hardware independence
• Software architecture
• Framework incorporation
• Application integration
• Data exchange

C-band satellite antennas are used frequently in areas of the world where signals can become degraded due to heavy rain or other intense climate-related conditions. As a rule, C-band satellite antennas range in size from 1.8 meters to 2.4 meters. C-band satellite communications suffer less from rain attenuation, but they require larger antennas and typically are used in Asia, Africa and Latin America. See also antenna, frequency bands, Ka-band, Ku-band and satellite dish.

CBD (component-based development)

A set of reuse-enabling technologies, tools and techniques that allow applications development (AD) organizations to go through the entire AD process (i.e., analysis design, construction and assembly) or through any particular stage via the use of predefined component-enabling technologies (such as AD patterns, frameworks, design templates) tools and application building blocks.

C. See also IMT-A.

CDN (content delivery networks)

Pay-TV and VOD services are both delivered to homes using some form of content delivery network (CDN) that the carrier deploys over its core, aggregation and broadband access networks. The CDN usually takes the form of a managed IP network overlay that links the user’s STB to the subscriber management server, VOD streaming servers and multicast TV headend. In the case of broadcast channels, the CDN needs to be able to multicast hundreds of channels from the headend without too much jitter or packet loss. In the case of on-demand services, the CDN must have the capacity and intelligence to handle bandwidth-intensive unicast streams, all carrying different content to different customers.

A CDN is necessary to ensure that high quality of service (QOS) requirements for video are met. Customers will not pay for TV services that are erratic or of poorer quality than what they are used to with traditional technologies.

CDO (care delivery organization)

With such information, it is easier to spot exceptions to regular calling patterns such as out-of-hours calling, international calls, significant variances from previous reporting periods and call destinations that do not reflect normal calling patterns for the enterprise. Also known as station message detail recording (SMDR).

CDR (clinical data repository)

A database for storage of clinical information in a computer-based patient record (CPR).

CD-ROM (compact disc read-only memory)

A version of the standard compact disc intended to store general-purpose digital data. CD-ROMs can store a wide variety of data such as music, video and graphics.

CEBP applications segmentation

There are many ways in which enterprises could integrate communications with business processes – click-to-call and dial-by-directory are the simplest examples – but they do not easily demonstrate significant business benefits. This is because the personal productivity improvement associated with this type of application is difficult to evaluate. We have also seen early traction in customer-service applications such as proactive alerts of flight delays or changes in the travel sector, account-balance notifications and potential credit card fraud alerts via Short Message Service (SMS). These can be viewed as customer enhancements, but not as having a positive impact on business processes, because alerts that do have a positive impact on business processes have to be actionable and not just purely sent for information purposes only.

There are three key segments of CEBP application integrations. These segments demonstrate a positive impact on the efficiency of business processes and they provide a greater cost-justifiable rate of return, rather than focusing on less tangible personal productivity improvements. They are:

• Contextual presence.
• Flexible media and conferencing switching.

Also called line switching.

CIRP (cyber incident response plan)

Also known as a “computer incident response plan,” this is formulated by an enterprise to respond to potentially catastrophic, computer-related incidents, such as viruses or hacker attacks. The CIRP should include steps to determine whether the incident originated from a malicious source – and, if so, to contain the threat and isolate the enterprise from the attacker. (See cyber incident and CIRT.)

CIRT (cyber incident response team)

Also known as a “computer incident response team,” this group is responsible for responding to security breaches, viruses and other potentially catastrophic incidents in enterprises that face significant security risks. In addition to technical specialists capable of dealing with specific threats, it should include experts who can guide enterprise executives on appropriate communication in the wake of such incidents. The CIRT normally operates in conjunction with other enterprise groups, such as site security, public-relations and disaster recovery teams. (See cyber incident and CIRP.)

clickstream analysis

A form of Web analytics (see separate entry), clickstream analysis is the tracking and analysis of visits to Web sites. Although there are other ways to collect this data, clickstream analysis typically uses the Web server log files to monitor and measure Web site activity. This analysis can be used to report user behavior on a specific Web site, such as routing, stickiness (a user’s tendency to remain at the Web site), where users come from and where they go from the site. It can also be used for more aggregate measurements, such as the number of hits (visits), page views, and unique and repeat visitors, which are of value in understanding how the Web site operates from a technical, user experience and business perspective.

click-through

Term applied to the act of clicking with a mouse button on a Web page advertisement, which brings the user to the advertiser’s site.

closed-loop MRP (closed-loop material requirements planning)

A system built around MRP that also includes production planning, master production schedule, and capacity requirements planning. Once the planning phase is complete and the plans have been accepted as realistic and attainable, the execution functions come into play. These include the shop floor control functions of input/output measurement, detailed scheduling and dispatching, as well as anticipated delay reports from both the shop and vendors, purchasing follow-up and control, and other functions. The term “closed loop” implies that not only is each of these elements included in the overall system, but also that there is feedback from the execution functions so the planning can be kept valid at all times.

cloud

The “cloud” is identified as a purely abstract concept, originating in the presentation representations of the Internet and networks for many years. The cloud comes into existence when one or more cloud services is delivered to one or more customers.

cloud communications service provider

An entity that leverages the cloud environment to provide telecommunication and other services.

CLV (constant linear velocity)

One of two standards for rotating storage media, in which the disk spins at a higher speed on the outside tracks than on the inside tracks (where the circumference is smaller), so that all data moves past the head at the same rate. The other standard is constant angular velocity (CAV), in which the disk spins at the same rate at all times.

CM (configuration management)

CM software includes both stand-alone products and suites of products that can initially provision/configure desktops, servers or mobile devices, and then manage the change of configuration settings, software, and increasingly the files and data on those elements on an ongoing basis. Included in this category are stand-alone products for software distribution, various discovery requirements, remote control, software packaging, personality migration, software usage metering and mobile device management. Also included here are product suites that lead with provisioning and CM but may include features such as asset discovery, automated backup, bare-metal boot, self-healing functionality, data synchronization, security, virtualization — both application and hosted virtual desktops (HVD) — or even help desk features. When these features are sold as stand-alone products, revenue is counted in other categories. There are many tools that offer one or more of the functions above, and these are included as well. Some solutions for servers, for instance, offer robust configuration auditing and remediation, and others have more-targeted solutions with deep configuration auditing and reporting to meet a variety of auditing requirements (such as security, regulatory, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, “gold” or trusted configuration baselining). This category also contains CM database tools and supporting technology to discover and populate them, which includes IT service dependency mapping tools.

CM is for production systems only. CM is distinct from software configuration management (SWCM), which is used by programmers to manage the change and configuration of development systems. Some SWCM and CM vendors are partnering to provide a linkage between systems. Finally, the CM category does not include vendors that position products primarily as electronic software distribution or as content distribution used in Internet distribution scenarios (B2B or business-to-consumer [B2C]).

CM (content management)

Perform tracking and reporting, keeping track of the results of the course taken, how well the student performed in the course, and what the student should take next. This information would be stored and forwarded to other human resources (HR) systems.

CMC (common messaging calls)

A set of calls developed by the X.400 API Association (XAPIA) for use on top of any existing messaging system. Programmers developing applications using these calls may request services of whatever messaging system is accepting the call. The number of calls is limited to the most popular messaging and directory lookup functions. CMC is similar to simple Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) in its breadth of services, but provides greater portability of applications.

CoDA (context delivery architecture)

CoDA is defined as an architectural style that builds on service-oriented architecture (SOA) and event-driven architecture (EDA) interaction and partitioning styles, and adds formal mechanisms for the software elements that discover and apply the user’s context in real time. CoDA provides a framework for solution architects that allows them to define and implement the technology, information and process components that enable services to use context information to improve the quality of the interactions with the user. The technologies may include context brokers, state monitors, sensors, analytic engines and cloud-based transaction processing engines.

Codd’s Rule Zero

Ted Codd, whose theoretical work on relational databases stimulated today’s plethora of relational products, defined a fundamental “Rule Zero” for classifying relational database management systems (RDBMSs). The intent of this rule was to help enterprises focus on the requirement for a consistent integrity layer in the RDBMSs they evaluated: “For any system that is advertised as, or claimed to be, a relational database management system, that system must be able to manage databases entirely through its relational capabilities, no matter what additional capabilities the system may support.”

codec (coder/decoder)

A device used to convert analog signals, such as speech, music, or television, to digital form for transmission over a digital medium, and back again to the original analog form. One is required at each end of the channel.

cognitive radio

Dynamically identifies how spectrum is being used and chooses appropriate frequencies, protocols and modulation to coexist with other devices. Cognitive radio builds on the principles of SDR and generally requires changes in legislation controlling how spectrum is allocated and exploited; thus, it’s unlikely to be mainstream before 2012. See also SDR.

COL (Component Object Library)

The object library in Microsoft’s Component Object Model (COM).

COLD (computer output to laserdisc)

commerce platform servers

Commerce (B2B and B2C) software servers and tools are used to build systems that sell, service, market and buy products to customers and businesses through the Web and channel partners. These servers build systems for enterprises to automate their Web sales process and customer experience, gain insight into customer behavior and preferences, improve visibility into channel activities and performance, and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. This market segment is made up of servers and tools that are used to build and sell these solutions, not the applications themselves.

communications as a service (CaaS)

This is communications functionality that may include telephony, messaging, conferencing, presence and notification, based on assets owned, managed and co-located by third parties.

communications service provider (see CSP)

community

A constantly changing group of people collaborating and sharing their ideas over an electronic network (e.g., the Internet). Communities optimize their collective power by affiliation around a common interest, by the compression of the time between member interactions (i.e., communicating in real time), and by asynchronous “postings” that potentially reach more participants and permit more reflection time than real-time interactions.

community antenna television (see CATV)

community of practice

People associated and interlinked in a communication or knowledge network because of their shared interest or shared responsibility for a subject area. Examples are people who hold similar job functions (project managers, department managers, team leaders or customer service agents); all the people on a project team; and people interested in specific technologies (e-commerce or network management). Communities continually emerge and dissolve, and their membership, processes and knowledge continually change and evolve.

compandor

The combination of a compressor at one point in a communications path, for reducing the volume range of signals, followed by an expandor at another point, for restoring the original volume range. It is designed to improve the ratio of the signal to the interference entering the path between the compressor and expandor.

compass technology

A digital compass, or magnetometer, which is a sensor measuring the Earth’s magnetic field to determine the direction to the magnetic poles. Critical for mobile devices is the implementation of 3-axis compasses or magnetometer sensors in combination with accelerometer sensors to provide tilt compensation when the device is not held horizontally.

competency center

An organizational structure used to coordinate IT skills with an enterprise. Competency centers provide expertise for project or program support, acting both as repositories of knowledge and resource pools for multiple business areas. Skills-based competency centers, the most common type in an information services organization, are used for application development, software language skills, data management, Internet development and network design. Within the enterprise, it is increasingly common to find competency centers (or shared services) for travel, finance and human resources. Repository-based competencies act exclusively as sources of information.

component

Technically, a dynamically bindable package of functionality that is managed as a unit and accessed through documented interfaces that can be discovered at runtime. Pragmatically, components tend to fall into two major groups: technical components, which perform a technology-specific task that is application-independent (e.g., a graphical user interface control), and business components, which encapsulate a piece of business functionality.

composite application

An emerging applications architecture in which functionality and data from multiple applications are exploited to present an integrated user interface. A composite application is one that has the appearance of a single application (from the point of view of the end user) but is, in fact, composed of multiple, independently designed applications. They defragment the end user’s view into data, providing, for example, a “customer-centric” perspective in which all relevant information on a customer is accessible from a single user interface. The enabling software required for a composite application is essentially a hub for connections between back-end (often legacy) systems and systems designed to interact with end users (e.g., Windows clients, Web servers and integrated computer-telephony systems).

composite content applications (CCAs)

Composite content applications is the term used to define frameworks and templates that are built on enterprise content management and/or business process management platforms. CCAs describe the orchestration of people, process and content based on repeatable solutions delivered by vendors and their domain expert partners in vertical and horizontal application development.

Compression

NTFS supports file- and directory-level compression. The compression is performed transparently when the file is read or written. Any new files in a compressed directory will automatically be compressed.

See also: Compression Unit

Compression Unit

Each file marked to be compressed is divided into sixteen cluster blocks, known as compression units. If one of these blocks cannot be compressed into fifteen clusters or less it is left uncompressed. This division also helps accessing a file randomly, ie it isn’t necessary to decompress the whole file.

computing appliance

A computing device that provides pre-defined services, and that has its underlying operating (OS) software hidden beneath an application-specific interface. Computing appliances offer reduced complexity (e.g., installation, administration and maintenance) and faster deployment by hiding the operating software and embedding the application within the device. A computing appliance may be based on a general-purpose OS (e.g., Windows, Solaris or Linux) if the OS’s complexity is hidden and the ability to load arbitrary services is removed.

Computing appliances can provide one or more services; however, they not general-purpose devices in that they are not flexible in the services they provide. Administrators do not need platform expertise — just limited application and appliance-specific expertise.

There are four fundamental types of computing appliances – see separate entries for server appliance, storage appliance, network appliance and client appliance.

computing platform products

Computing platform products are defined as follows:

• Server systems – The server segment comprises all multiuser systems. Please note that supercomputers and mainframes are no longer classified as discrete segments. As the technology, use and positioning differentiation between the server segments has eroded, all multiuser systems are now classified as general-purpose servers.
• Workstations – Workstations are single-user systems including high-end, midrange, and entry-level workstations. Workstations are typically high-end complex instruction set computer (CISC), explicitly parallel instruction computing or RISC-based CPU architectures with high-performance graphics, OS and system architecture. In general, workstations must include integrated floating-point processing, integrated networking, a 32-bit or 64-bit multitasking OS, as well as configurations that support high-resolution graphics capabilities and 3D graphics functionality. The workstation market includes traditional Unix workstations, such as Linux and workstations running Windows 2000/XP or other advanced OSs. Workstations are classified by the primary market for which they are designed and bases its data collection on desktops branded as workstations. Systems shipped with Windows Media Center Edition are generally counted as PCs and not included in the workstation category and, because they are not branded as workstations, neither are Apple Macintosh desktops. Examples of x86-based workstations are IBM’s IntelliStation family, Dell Precision Workstations and HP Workstations. Note that the Intel-compatible 32-bit CPU (x86-32) category refers to Intel Architecture (IA)-compatible, x86-based workstations and covers a variety of chipset and processor designs not offered by Intel. Note also that the Itanium processor family of CPUs, such as Itanium2 and 64-bit extensions to CISC architecture, including as AMD’s Opteron- and Athlon64-based workstations, will be listed separately under the titles of IA-64 and (Intel-compatible 64-bit CPU) x86-64, respectively.
• PCs — PCs are single-user systems including x86 (Intel-compatible CPU) server, desk-based and mobile PCs. A PC is a general purpose computer that is distinguished from other computers by its adherence to hardware and software compatibility. This compatibility drives high-unit volumes of commoditylike products that do not require on-site technical support. High-performance features, such as networking, graphics and a virtual multiuser/multitasking OS, are normally optional and not integral system features. IBM/IBM-compatible and Apple PCs are two platforms in this product segment. A single-user PC’s resident OS is typically Windows, Mac OS and Linux. PCs have a performance ceiling that is lower in system compute performance, input/output (I/O) channel speed and disk speed than advanced workstations. Standard graphics are in the 1024 x 768 to 1280 x 1068-pixel range, and optional high-end graphics are limited compared with workstations. A PC system is viewed as a single unit, which includes a CPU, a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard. Furthermore, this definition does not include thin-client terminal.

concentrator

A device that merges many low-speed asynchronous channels into one or more high-speed synchronous channels to achieve economies of data transmission.

concurrent backup

A system-level facility to allow a database or disk file to be backed up to another disk or to magnetic tape while it is still open for application access.

concurrent database restore

A system-level facility to allow a database or portion thereof to be restored while the database is still open for application access.

concurrent use

A way to measure the usage of software licenses. Software can be licensed in one of the following ways: individual (it cannot be shared with other users); site (a limited number of people can use the software); concurrent use (usage is limited to a maximum number of users at a particular time). The software vendor usually sets the guidelines on the type of software license. Monitoring is facilitated by the vendor or by the user. When software usage is measured by the user, the vendor can require a user to supply detailed reports or can rely on the user’s pledge. Enterprises can avoid liability and save money by accurately measuring the number of users.

conditioning

A procedure that restricts transmission impairments of a circuit to certain specified limits.

conductor

Any equipment, such as a wire or cable, that can carry an electric current.
One wire of a multiwire cable.

connection

A unique, active service access point to a network. This includes machine-to-machine network access as well as human access. In mobile networks, this may be taken to refer to an active subscriber identity module (SIM). A single subscriber may operate several different cellular connections and multiple connections may be associated with one customer or one mobile device.

connectionless

The interconnection model in which communication takes place without first establishing a connection.

connectionless service

In a connectionless service, no fixed path is set up between sender and recipient. Every unit of data that is exchanged is self-contained in that it contains all the necessary control and address information to ensure correct delivery, e.g., packet switching.

connection-oriented service

A service in which a connection (real or virtual) is set up and maintained for the duration of the communication. See circuit switching.

connect time

The amount of time that a circuit, typically in a circuit switched environment, is in use. See holding time.

console

The part of a computer used for communicating between the user and the system. A cathode ray tube (CRT) terminal with mouse and keyboard is the most common type.

consumer broadband access revenue

This is revenue from retail broadband services provided to residential customers. The revenue here reflects only that generated from providing the physical broadband access connection into the home. Revenue generated from providing Internet access services over this connection are not counted under this segment but rather under the Internet access revenue segment, even though it is very common for customers to pay a single charge for both services as a single non-transparent fee. That said, there are plenty of markets where consumers buy broadband access and Internet access separately and sometimes from different providers. In markets where broadband access and Internet access are sold as a bundled single product, we calculate the relative revenue splits between the two services, primarily by using broadband access wholesale rates offered by carriers to ISPs for resale as a guide.

Broadband access is divided into four areas:

• FTTH/FTTP/Ethernet revenue — This segment includes services provided to residential customers that involve FTTH and FTTP combined with Ethernet in the last mile. This revenue includes the monthly recurring price for service (including the modem lease cost if there is any) and initial installation and activation/provisioning charges.
• DSL revenue — This revenue segment includes xDSL services provided to residential customers. This category comprises all variants of DSL but, in the main, refers to asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), ADSL2/ADSL2+ and very high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL). Any access line that has any variety of xDSL (such as FTTN) in the last mile is counted as a DSL. DSL revenue includes the monthly recurring fee for the DSL services (including the modem lease cost if any) and a one-off charge for initial installation and activation/provisioning.
• Cable modem revenue — This revenue segment includes consumer retail revenue from residential cable modem and hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) services. The revenue forecast includes the monthly service cost for the cable modem. Initial installation and provisioning charges are also included in the revenue.
• Other high-speed access revenue — This revenue segment includes all consumer retail revenue from all other consumer broadband technologies in use to the home, where they are used as a mostly static fixed-line replacement technology for the main types of broadband access. They include fixed wireless (multichannel multipoint distribution service [MMDS], local multipoint distribution service [LMDS], proprietary and standards-based Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access [WiMAX]), satellite broadband and power lines. Wireless PC cards/dongles are not included in this forecast; they are included in the mobile forecast. The revenue forecast includes the lease cost of the customer premises equipment (CPE), where applicable.

consumer broadband connections

A broadband connection is a direct path between two termination points, one of which is in the consumer’s home, the other at the carrier’s central office (CO) or local broadband aggregation node. In the case of wireless broadband access, it is a wireless connection between the home and the aggregation node. The number of connections is equal to the number of in-service lines that are subscribed to by consumers.

consumer broadband services

• A broadband line is a connection between a consumer’s home and a carrier’s network that provides data access services of at least 256 Kbps. In most cases this is a physical connection using copper-based DSL, cable modem or FTTH/FTTP with Ethernet in the last mile in a building. However, other emerging access technologies are also included, such as wireless broadband, satellite and power lines when they are used as replacement technologies for residential fixed-line broadband.
• Broadband services revenue includes all the retail revenue associated with providing broadband access to consumers. This does not include IP services revenue — especially Internet access revenue — that is commonly bundled with the broadband line. Broadband access and Internet access are two different services, and Internet access revenue is reflected in the Internet segment.

consumer Internet access revenue

This is total consumer revenue produced by ISPs for providing Internet access services. Subscriptions are provided over a dial-up or broadband connection. Revenue associated with the broadband connection is not included at this point; it is included in the broadband subscription segment. Internet access revenue does not include value-added ISP services such as e-mail accounts, filtering and security.

consumer Internet services

• Consumer Internet services are data services provided by ISPs that connect subscribers to the Internet using either a dial-up connection over a PSTN line or over a broadband connection. Typically, these are flat rate or metered services based on time or data usage.
• Consumer Internet accounts represent the number of active fee-paying individual consumer accounts that can be associated with commercial ISPs. In general these accounts service subscribers who are connecting from home.

consumer NAS (consumer network attached storage)

A consumer NAS is defined as a centralized, multifunction storage system for the home network. It can function as a file server with remote access to multiple PCs and media players, a print server, a media server, a backup and archive system, and temporary storage for Internet downloads or video-on-demand.

consumer voice access lines

Consumer voice access lines is the sum of PSTN (including consumer channel counts for consumer Integrated Services Digital Network [ISDN]) and VoIP connections. Note that “virtual” VoIP connections used for voice communications, usually via a broadband connection to the Internet or some other IP network. The “virtual” line has to be associated with a telephone number that allows it to receive incoming PSTN calls.

consumer voice revenue

Revenues from all PSTN and VoIP retail voice lines are combined into one total consumer revenue forecast. The components of this one line are made up of domestic and international calling and connection usage attributed to each type of voice line.

Consumer voice revenue is the sum of:

• Revenue from retail domestic and international consumer usage that can be identified as having taken place over the PSTN or via VoIP; including revenue for charges paid for on a per-minute basis or bundled/flat rate calling plan charges. Calling packages that are bundled into the monthly charges – for example, unlimited or 1,000 minutes – are also reflected here.
• Flat-rate revenue received by a service provider (PSTN or VoIP) on a monthly basis for providing the connection/line dial tone service, telephone number and any recurring voice value-added services. Revenue also includes one-off charges relating to the line, such as one-time installation changes.

consumer voice services

Voice service revenue and connections are made up of the sum of PSTN and voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connections and their associated revenue. For clarification, IP-based voice “virtual” connections (VoIP) are those calls delivered over a broadband Internet connection or other IP network. A VoIP virtual line needs to be associated with a telephone number and be identifiable to the consumer as a VoIP-grade service. A VoIP line and PSTN line are not mutually exclusive — indeed, most consumers with VoIP lines still have a PSTN line.

contact center

Also called a “customer contact center,” this includes all customer contact channels, including telephone, interactive voice response (IVR), speech recognition, e-mail, Web and fax. This is an inbound and outbound service-based environment in which customer service representatives handle all types of contacts regarding sales, customer service and support (CSS), marketing and other functions.

contact center customer service software

These applications or functions are designed to enable employees or agents of a company to support clients directly, usually within a call or contact center, typically with nonproduct support focused on service that is business-related (such as dissatisfaction and problems with shipment and billing).

contact center infrastructure

This infrastructure includes software and hardware designed to run a contact/call center. This includes automatic call distributors, integrated voice response units, computer-telephony integration, and universal communications or universal queue management, integrating any of these multiple channels for a call/contact center.

contact center suite

This contains all the components of a call center suite (see separate entry) with additional functions to support non-phone-based inquiry channels such as Web and e-mail communication. This added functionality includes:

• Web contact functions (e.g., Web chat and collaborative browsing)
• E-mail response management system (ERMS) functions
• Unified messaging
• Tools for integration with front- and back-office applications, or with applications that support customer relationship management (CRM) strategies

In this definition, the CRM applications that support marketing, sales, customer service and support, or field service and dispatch are not considered part of the suite. However, contact center suite functionality is often included with CRM applications and sold as a bundled CRM suite.

(See call center, contact center, ERMS and CRM.)

contact center systems

Contract center systems are defined as computer-based systems that provide call and contact routing for high-volume telephony transactions, with specialist answering “agent” stations and a sophisticated real-time contact management system. The definition includes all contact center systems that provide inbound contact handling capabilities and automatic contact distribution, combined with a high degree of sophistication in terms of dynamic contact traffic management.

Contact center systems are defined as follows:

• They are software applications typically residing on an adjunct server or switch-based processor system, located either at a customer’s premises or at a third-party site. For routing phone calls, the system providing the call control may be an application-specific resource or may support a dual-function PBX/automatic call distributor installation. Newer architectures will support contact center call routing business rules on an “application server” which can direct and monitor calls through a telephony gateway using SIP or other softswitch protocols. The infrastructure may also be provided as an on-site “managed service;” as an off-site, dedicated “hosted service” solution; or as an off-site shared resource “software as a service” (SaaS) solution.
• They provide intelligent routing of an incoming communication (that is, a call, e-mail, text chat, Web collaboration or facsimile) to the appropriate resource (that is, agent-assisted or self-service) through an algorithm more sophisticated than simple hunt groups.
• They provide the ability to generate historical activity reports (covering at least 30 days) as well as supervisory capabilities including, but not limited to, real-time monitoring and reporting of a system’s workload, agent status lookups, viewing the number of contacts in the queue, and the ability to change agent status.

contact center technical support software

These applications or functions are designed to enable employees or agents of a company to support clients directly, usually within a call or contact center, typically focused on clients’ product use, implementation and problem resolution.

contact center workforce optimization

A workforce optimization solution integrates disparate contact center technologies — including contact center performance management, e-learning, interaction analytics, quality management and workforce management — which execute against a high-level framework encompassing strategic contact center planning; agent recruitment, deployment, monitoring, evaluation, improvement and motivation; and corporate accountability and contribution.

contact chips

Chips used in smart cards that are inserted into a reader to conduct transactions or pass information from the card to the reader. Contactless chips can perform a function by being passed near a reader. Contactless chips are often preferred for use in applications where speed is essential.

contact database

A database containing names, addresses and other information on sales contacts , used for contact tracking and management purposes.

contactless card

Chip-based Near Field Communication (NFC) card based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies that use RFs to transmit data, and which needs no physical contact to be read by readers or terminals. Contactless cards are waved near the reader to record transactions or to identify the user. Systems are either passive, with the readers generating the frequency, or active, in which case the card activates the reader. Sony’s FeliCa chip card technology (which has been integrated into mobile phones for m-banking and m-commerce in Japan) is an example.

content

In commercial publishing, content refers to individual documents that can be graphic, textual or illustrative in nature, or amalgamations of documents that can be combined into individual articles or complete publications. On the Internet, the term refers to the content of Web sites.

content aggregation

The presentation of content from multiple sources at a single Web location for review by the customer.

content analytics

content analytics refers to applications that process unstructured data to derive answers to specific questions. It may consist of a single function — for example, fact or concept extraction — or a series of functions that pass results in a sequence from one operation to the next. It does not consist solely of new information access components, but it does depend on newer approaches to how processing steps are serialized and information is passed from one application to the next.

content-based retrieval (see CBR)

content, communications and collaboration

The content, communications and collaboration software market sector comprises software products, tools and hosted services to organize, access, use and share content. Content management and/or collaboration initiatives involve managing and interacting with a multitude of content types, including documents, records, images, forms and, increasingly, digital media. Included in this market sector are enterprise content management (ECM), e-mail and calendaring, Web conferencing and shared work spaces/team collaboration, IM, e-learning suites, information access with search, and ECM systems.

For the enterprise application software segment, content, communications and collaboration software does not include products targeted at specific business functions or processes, such as engineering design or customer service and support, in which some form of collaboration and knowledge management capability is included as part of the packaged application.

content management (see CM)

content provider

An enterprise with information-based (i.e., content) products; it also includes services to access and manage the content.

contention

A method of line control in which the terminals request to transmit. If the channel in question is free, transmission proceeds; if it is not free, the terminal must wait until it becomes free.

context

Refers to meanings that are clear to the sender or receiver (e.g., application or person), either because they are stated elsewhere in the message or because they have been predefined (e.g., the number “30” means “30 pounds of flour” in one message and “30 cases of orange soda” in another message). Sender and receiver may have different interpretations of meaning (i.e., different context). For example, “customer” could be the party that pays the freight bill in a billing application, but the receiver of the item (which might not be the payer) in a warehousing application.

context delivery architecture (see CoDA)

Context-aware computing

Context-aware computing is defined as the concept of leveraging information about the end user to improve the quality of the interaction. Context-aware computing is about improving the user experience for customers, business partners and employees by using the information about a person or object’s environment, activities, connections and preferences to anticipate the user’s needs and proactively serve up the most appropriate content, product or service. Enterprises can leverage context-aware computing to better target prospects, increase customer intimacy, and enhance associate productivity and collaboration. From a software perspective, context is information that is relevant to the functioning of a software process, but is not essential to it. In the absence of this additional information, the software is still operational, although the results of the software’s actions are not as targeted or refined.

context delivery architecture

An architectural style that builds on service-oriented architecture (SOA) and event-driven architecture (EDA) interaction and partitioning styles, and adds formal mechanisms for the software elements that discover and apply the user’s context in real time. CoDA provides a framework for solution architects that allows them to define and implement the technology, information and process components that enable services to use context information to improve the quality of the interactions with the user.

context-enriched services

Context-enriched services are defined as those that use context to form compelling, situation-aware and intuitive functions that anticipate and react to end users’ immediate needs.

context management engine

A core enabling technology for effective portals, this application collects, analyzes and distributes personalization and customization information.

contextual presence

Contextual presence is a context-specific list that is created according to specific and current needs. Contextual presence allows users such as medical staff, technical assistants and financial brokers to determine who is available to assist with a specific customer request. Contextual presence lists can be integrated with location services.

contingent workforce

core storage management

Products in the core storage management segment provide basic data organization functions, such as file system and volume management, storage virtualization software, thin provisioning, disk utilities, access and path management, and emerging technologies that do not fit into one of the other segments. Storage virtualization software, whether on a server or in the storage network or in the disk array, creates an abstraction layer that separates physical storage from logical storage, masks complexities to simplify storage management and enables storage resource optimization via pooling. Network file systems, file systems that are part of the core OS or essential for the operation of the storage device, and high-availability (such as clustering) software products are not included.

COS (class of service)

An Internet service provider (ISP) offering that prioritizes which traffic is delivered before other traffic. With COS, when an ISP’s network is not congested, all traffic is treated equally. When the network is congested, however, traffic that has been designated as a higher priority will be delivered first, while lower priority traffic will be held in a queue until the higher-class traffic has been transmitted.

COSE (Common Open Software Environment)

A now-defunct vendor consortium, which was formed to promote interoperability and portability across Unix platforms. The group’s first project was the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) specification.

CPEMH (computer-aided patient-entered medical history)

A system that presents a series of questions, thereby collecting data that traditionally would require a receptionist, a “traditional clipboard,” a nurse and a doctor. These systems use knowledge management and branching logic to tailor each session to the individual patient. Once the data is collected, it can be parsed, translated and highlighted. The clinician then has access to data prior to seeing the patient and can better direct the encounter.

CPE external stand-alone modem

This modem does not go inside a PC, but has its own external casing and power supply, and is connected to a PC using a cable.

CPE internal modem

This modem is placed inside a PC. It is not a PC Card.

CPGA (cost per gross add)

Typically, the cost of sales and marketing, advertising and handset subsidies over total gross adds.

CPI (continuous process improvement)

A methodology for improving production, driven by formal metrics and measurement programs, including methodology upgrades.

CPM (corporate performance management)

CPM is an umbrella term that describes the methodologies, metrics, processes and systems used to monitor and manage the business performance of an enterprise. Applications that enable CPM translate strategically focused information to operational plans and send aggregated results. These applications are also integrated into many elements of the planning and control cycle, or they address BAM or customer relationship optimization needs.

CPM must be supported by a suite of analytical applications that provide the functionality to support these processes, methodologies and metrics.

CPM (critical path method or critical path management)

Critical path method is a project planning and management methodology that focuses on activities that control the total duration of a project.

CPMS (corporate property management software)

Software whose basic functionality is to produce basic rent rolls and feed to general ledger; to track simple information about leased or owned property (e.g., renewal dates, term dates, amount of square footage and basic breakdown of divisions or departments in space for space allocation); and to capture data regarding parties to agreement and basic contract information.

CPM suites

The main application components of a CPM suite are defined as follows:

• Budgeting, planning and forecasting — These applications support the development of all aspects of budgets, plans and forecasts. They encompass short-term financially focused budgets, longer-term plans and high-level strategic plans. These applications should deliver workflow capabilities to manage budget/plan creation, submission and approval, as well as provide the ability to dynamically create forecasts and scenarios. They also should support the development of an enterprisewide planning model that links operational plans with financial budgets. In addition, they must be capable of sharing data with domain-specific applications, such as SCP.
• Profitability modeling and optimization — This includes activity-based costing (ABC) applications that determine and allocate costs at a highly granular level, and activity-based management applications that provide capabilities to enable users to model the impact on profitability of different cost and resource allocation strategies. Some applications have moved beyond the “traditional” ABC focus to enable revenue to be allocated in addition to costs to model packaging, bundling, pricing and channel strategies.
• Scorecard applications — A scorecard is a generic BI capability that includes the functionality of dashboards but that also has the capability to link key performance indicators (KPIs) to a strategy map, with a hierarchical cause-and-effect relationship among the KPIs. Scorecards are often used in conjunction with a particular methodology, such as the balanced scorecard, European Foundation for Quality Management, value-based management or Six Sigma.
• Financial consolidation — This type of application enables organizations to reconcile, consolidate, summarize and aggregate financial data based on different accounting standards and federal regulations. These applications are a fundamental part of CPM because they create the audited, enterprise-level view of financial information that must be shared with other CPM applications to analyze variance from targets.
• Statutory and financial reporting — CPM applications require specialized reporting tools that can format output as structured financial statements, and they may also need to support specific generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) presentation rules, such as U.S. GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards. They also include visualization techniques that are specifically designed to support the analysis of variance from budgets or targets, such as hyperbolic trees.

CPP (commercial parallel processing)

The use of parallel-processing systems for complex commercial applications.

CPR (computer-based patient record)

A system that contains electronically maintained information about an individual’s health status and care. It focuses on tasks directly related to patient care, unlike other healthcare information systems that support providers’ and payers’ operational processes (which may, however, serve as source or feeder systems for the CPR). The CPR completely replaces the paper medical chart and thus must meet all clinical, legal and administrative requirements.

CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface)

An industry cooperation between Ericsson, Nortel, NEC, Siemens and Huawei to define an open and published interface between radio equipment control and the radio equipment. Although open and freely available, this interface is not defined by 3GPP and is targeting WCDMA.

CPS (certification practice statement)

A document defining all the operational practices that will be used to maintain the required level of public-key infrastructure (PKI) security. To prove that issued certificates are valid, an enterprise must demonstrate (usually through an audit) adherence to its CPS. The Internet Engineering Task Force’s (IETF’s) request for comment (RFC) 2527 contains draft guidelines for the format and content of a CPS.

CPT (Current Procedural Terminology)

A widely used controlled medical vocabulary authored by the American Medical Association, this system describes medical and surgical procedures in a hierarchical format with six major sections and more than 7,300 codes. A series of two-digit modifiers are used to increase specificity, allowing the reporting of a procedure under specific circumstances.

CPU (central processing unit)

The component of a computer system that controls the interpretation and execution of instructions. The CPU of a PC consists of a single microprocessor, while the CPU of a more powerful mainframe consists of multiple processing devices, and in some cases, hundreds of them. The term “processor” is often used to refer to a CPU.

CQI (continuous quality improvement)

A methodology for to continuous improvement of the quality of an enterprise’s products, services or internal processes.

CRC (cyclic redundancy check)

An error detection technique using a polynomial to generate a series of two 8-bit block check characters that represent the entire block of data. These block check characters are incorporated into the transmission frame and then checked at the receiving end.

critical-path scheduling

A project-planning and monitoring system used to check progress toward the completion of a project by scheduling events, activities, milestones, etc.

critical ratio

A dispatching rule that calculates a priority index number by dividing the time to due date remaining by the expected elapsed time to finish the job. Typically ratios of less than 1.0 are behind, ratios greater than 1.0 are ahead, and a ratio of 1.0 is on schedule.

CRL (certificate revocation list)

A “hot lists” that identifies certificates that have been withdrawn, canceled or compromised or that should not be trusted because of other identified reasons. CRLs should be replicated to all subscribing servers to a specific root certification authority.

CRM (customer relationship management)

CRM (customer relationship management) is a business strategy whose outcomes optimize profitability, revenue and customer satisfaction by organizing around customer segments, fostering customer-satisfying behaviors and implementing customer-centric processes.

CRM analytics

A set of analyses that support customer relationship management (CRM) on both an individual-customer and an aggregate level, including the real-time monitoring of day-to-day operations. A significant aspect of performing true CRM analytics (as opposed to product or channel analytics) is the capability to integrate data and analyses across various distribution channels and business units, creating a holistic understanding of relationships.

CRM printing

A subset of CRM publishing, CRM printing is enabled by the combination of digital, low-to-high-volume printing devices and technology-enabled marketing techniques. The latter provide the data necessary for the former to produce personalized materials.

CRM publishing

The concept of using CRM techniques to micro segment prospective, current and former customers and to deliver targeted marketing and sales information based on the recipients’ requirements and preferred delivery method(s).

cross-certification

A process by which two enterprises are able to recognize and trust each other’s digital certificates.

cross-compiler

A program that translates instructions from a high-level language on one computer to the machine language of another computer – the one on which the program is to be run.

cross-docking

The planning of warehouse “put away” assignments so that inventory can be moved from one shipment to another on a dock without movement to a rack or warehouse location. Although this type of inventory movement may violate lot and code date movement parameters, cross-dock planning is used frequently to minimize labor costs and handling in warehouses and distribution centers.

cross-modulation

Interference caused by two or more carriers interacting in a transmission system.

CRP (capacity requirements planning)

The process of specifying the level of resources (facilities, equipment and labor force size) that best supports the enterprise’s competitive strategy for production.

CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete)

Guidelines for defining how different people or communities within an organization deal with data elements owned by the organization.

CSD (circuit-switched data)

CSD (consolidated service desk)

The hub where the needs of support groups, distributors, suppliers and customers are consolidated, and where network and systems management (NSM) tools are integrated. The CSD has become the integration point for multiple management disciplines, the single point of contact for providing multiple IS services to the end users, and the source of automation for multiple workflow processes.

CSF (critical success factor)

A methodology, management tool or design technique that enables the effective development and deployment of a project or process.

CSP (communications service provider)

Includes all service providers offering telecommunication services or some combination of information and media services, content, entertainment and applications services over networks, leveraging the network infrastructure as a rich, functional platform. CSPs include the following categories: Telecommunications carrier, content and applications service provider (CASP), cable service provider, satellite broadcasting operator, and cloud communications service provider.

CSS (customer service and support)

Once known as the “complaint department,” CSS is responsible for retaining and extending customer relationships once a product or service is sold. Due to the increasing complexity of customer interactions, customer service organizations need a complex technological infrastructure that is flexible, extensible and scalable and that integrates front-office applications with back-end processes and data. The components of CSS include

• Call management — The core functionality of CSS applications. This component is used to log all incoming telephone calls and transactions and to manage the transaction from initiation through closure.
• Internet-based customer service suites — Also known as e-service suites, these applications and tools empower customers, partners and prospects for self-service and interactions with the enterprise via the Web, an intranet or an extranet.
• Field service and dispatch (FS/D) systems — FS/D has become an essential element of complete CSS suites and is an important element of customer relationship management (CRM). FS/D software is evolving from solely back-office functionality to an enterprise system that tightly couples the back office with the front-office servicing systems.
• Contact centers — Traditional call centers handle voice-only customer contact, whereas contact centers include all types of channels of customer contact, including voice (e.g., telephone, IVR, speech recognition and voice verification), the Web, fax, video kiosks and e-mail. This is an inbound and outbound service-based environment in which agents handle all types of contacts regarding sales, customer service, marketing, telemarketing, collections and other functions.

CSU (channel service unit)

A device found on digital links that transfers data faster than a modem (in a range from 56 kilobits per second to 1.5 megabits per second) but does not permit dial-up functions. It also performs certain line-conditioning and equalization functions, and responds to loop-back commands sent from a central office. A CSU is the link between digital lines from the central office and devices such as channel banks or data communications devices.

current loop

A transmission technique that recognizes current flows rather than voltage levels. It was traditionally used in teletypewriter networks incorporating batteries as the transmission power source.

customer communications management (CCM)

Customer communications management (CCM) is a strategy and a market fulfilled by different applications to improve the creation, delivery, storage and retrieval of outbound and interactive communications. CCM supports the production of marketing collateral, new product introductions, and transaction documents (for example, renewal notifications, insurance claims correspondence, payment notifications). These interactions can happen through a wide range of media and output, including print, e-mail, Short Message Service (SMS), and Web pages and customer self-service. CCM solutions support enterprises’ communications with distributors, partners, regulatory bodies and customers. CCM is sometimes implemented as a composite content application. One technology descriptor common to most vendors is “document composition.”

customer experience

Customer experience is defined as “the customer’s perceptions and related feelings caused by the one-off and cumulative effect of interactions with a supplier’s employees, systems, channels or products.”

data center

The data center is the department in an enterprise that houses and maintains back-end information technology (IT) systems and data stores – its mainframes, servers and databases. In the days of large, centralized IT operations, this department and all the systems resided in one physical place, hence the name data center.

data center outsourcing

Data center outsourcing is a multiyear or annuity contract or relationship involving the day-to-day management responsibility for operating server/host platforms, including distributed servers and storage. Services include any combination (or all) of the product support and professional services as they specifically relate to the ongoing management of the computing and storage resources. Minimally, data center outsourcing contracts always include services encompassed by the computing platform of the operation services segment. Help desk management services are included only to the extent that problem determination and resolution is at the computing hardware level or the infrastructure software or OS software level. Application management services are included only to the extent of the infrastructure software or OS software level. Information management software and system management tools may be provided and used by the outsourcer or the enterprise client. Services may be provided at the client site or off-site. IT assets may be owned by either the client or the ESP, or a third party. Contracts may include the transfer of client employees, IT assets and facilities to the ESP.

data integration tools

The discipline of data integration comprises the practices, architectural techniques and tools for achieving the consistent access and delivery of data across the spectrum of data subject areas and data structure types in the enterprise to meet the data consumption requirements of all applications and business processes.

Data integration tools have traditionally been delivered via a set of related markets, with vendors in each market offering a specific style of data integration tool. In recent years, most of the activity has been within the ETL tool market. Markets for replication tools, data federation (EII) and other submarkets each included vendors offering tools optimized for a particular style of data integration, and periphery markets (such as data quality tools, adapters and data modeling tools) also overlapped with the data integration tool space. The result of all this historical fragmentation in the markets is the equally fragmented and complex way in which data integration is accomplished in large enterprises — different teams using different tools, with little consistency, lots of overlap and redundancy, and no common management or leverage of metadata. Technology buyers have been forced to acquire a portfolio of tools from multiple vendors to amass the capabilities necessary to address the full range of their data integration requirements.

This situation is now changing, with the separate and distinct data integration tool submarkets converging at the vendor and technology levels. This is being driven by buyer demands as organizations realize they need to think about data integration holistically and have a common set of data integration capabilities they can use across the enterprise. It is also being driven by the actions of vendors, such as those in individual data integration submarkets organically expanding their capabilities into neighboring areas, as well as by acquisition activity that brings vendors from multiple submarkets together. The result is a market for complete data integration tools that address a range of different data integration styles and are based on common design tooling, metadata and runtime architecture.

The data integration tool market comprises vendors that offer software products to enable the construction and implementation of data access and delivery infrastructure for a variety of data integration scenarios, including:

Data acquisition for BI and data warehousing – Extracting data from operational systems, transforming and merging that data, and delivering it to integrated data structures for analytic purposes. BI and data warehousing remains a mainstay of the demand for data integration tools.

Creation of integrated master data stores – Enabling the consolidation and rationalization of the data and representing critical business entities, such as customers, products and employees. Master data management (MDM) may or may not be subject-based, and data integration tools can be used to build the data consolidation and synchronization processes that are key to success.

Data migrations and conversions – These were traditionally addressed most often via the custom coding of conversion programs, but data integration tools are increasingly addressing the data movement and transformation challenges inherent in the replacement of legacy applications and consolidation efforts during merger and acquisition activities.

Synchronization of data between operational applications – Similar in concept to each of the prior scenarios, data integration tools provide the capability to ensure database-level consistency across applications, both on an internal and interenterprise basis, and in a bidirectional or unidirectional manner.

Creation of federated views of data from multiple data stores – Data federation, often referred to as EII, is growing in popularity as an approach for providing real-time integrated views across multiple data stores without physical movement of data. Data integration tools are increasingly including this type of virtual federation capability.

Delivery of data services in an SOA context – An architectural technique, rather than a data integration usage itself, data services are the emerging trend for the role and implementation of data integration capabilities within SOAs. Data integration tools will increasingly enable the delivery of many types of data services.

Unification of structured and unstructured data – This is also not a specific use case itself, and it is relevant to each of the above scenarios. There is an early but growing trend toward leveraging data integration tools for merging structured and unstructured data sources as organizations work on delivering a holistic information infrastructure that addresses all data types.

The following describes the different functional capabilities that are included in data integration tools:

• Data integration adapters – Data integration adapters provide simplified connectivity and access to databases, files and other data structures to enable applications and other data integration tools to perform read and update operations. Using adapters, applications and tools can reach into a variety of database types to access data for a range of purposes. This technology is commonly used to make legacy data accessible to more-modern applications and processes.
• Data federation – Federation technology, sometimes referred to as EII, executes distributed queries across multiple databases to create a “virtual data layer.” By leaving the data in place, this approach provides integrated views of data without creating a physical database to house them. These integrated views can be consumed and manipulated by applications, other integration infrastructure components, or query and reporting tools via SQL interfaces, XML or Web services. The data view is virtual in the sense that it resides only in memory or cache (that is, it generally is not persisted for long-term storage and is not backed up in its intermediate form). Data federation tools leave the application data in place, in contrast to ETL tools, which perform data movement to create a new copy of data. Federation tools can access a range of heterogeneous data sources on different platforms. Data may be cached for performance reasons and thus may not be entirely virtual. The early usage of data federation products tends to be simplistic, generally not addressing complex transformations, data cleansing or updates. This is typically because of the performance challenges inherent in delivering large-scale federated views.
• Data replication/synchronization – Data replication/synchronization technology enables the creation and ongoing maintenance of multiple copies of data. Replication/synchronization is generally focused on real-time consistency of transactions between databases. Although most replication/synchronization scenarios tend to be between homogeneous DBMSs and schemas, some replication/synchronization technology supports heterogeneous environments as well. A common use pattern for replication/synchronization technology is maintaining consistency of data between multiple, geographically dispersed instances of an operational application.
• ETL – ETL technology supports the acquisition and integration of data from multiple-source databases and provides the ability to change the syntax and semantics of that data and then deliver it to one or more target databases. ETL technology typically supports the movement of data for batch-oriented data integration processes, often in the context of building an integrated data structure, such as a data warehouse or master data store. BI-oriented data integration has been the traditional focus of ETL vendors; however, there is a trend toward broader use of the tools, particularly for implementing batch-oriented data consistency integration patterns between operational applications. ETL technology is well-suited when low-latency delivery of data is not a requirement and rich set-based transformation capabilities are important.

data mining

The process of discovering meaningful correlations, patterns and trends by sifting through large amounts of data stored in repositories. Data mining employs pattern recognition technologies, as well as statistical and mathematical techniques.

data quality tools

The market for data quality tools has become highly visible in recent years as more organizations understand the impact of poor-quality data and seek solutions for improvement. Traditionally aligned with cleansing of customer data (names and addresses) in support of CRM-related activities, the tools have expanded well beyond such capabilities, and forward-thinking organizations are recognizing the relevance of these tools in other data domains. Product data – often driven by MDM initiatives – and financial data (driven by compliance pressures) are two such areas in which demand for the tools is quickly building.

Data quality tools are used to address various aspects of the data quality problem:

• Parsing and standardization – Decomposition of text fields into component parts and formatting of values into consistent layouts based on industry standards, local standards (for example, postal authority standards for address data), user-defined business rules, and knowledge bases of values and patterns
• Generalized “cleansing” – Modification of data values to meet domain restrictions, integrity constraints or other business rules that define sufficient data quality for the organization
• Matching – Identification, linking or merging related entries within or across sets of data
• Profiling – Analysis of data to capture statistics (metadata) that provide insight into the quality of the data and aid in the identification of data quality issues
• Monitoring – Deployment of controls to ensure ongoing conformance of data to business rules that define data quality for the organization
• Enrichment – Enhancing the value of internally held data by appending related attributes from external sources (for example, consumer demographic attributes or geographic descriptors)

The tools provided by vendors in this market are generally consumed by technology users for internal deployment in their IT infrastructure, although hosted data quality solutions are continuing to emerge and grow in popularity. The tools are increasingly implemented in support of general data quality improvement initiatives, as well as within critical applications, such as ERP, CRM and BI. As data quality becomes increasingly pervasive, many data integration tools now include data quality management functionality.

data replication

The data replication segment includes a set of data replication products that reside in the disk array controller, in a device in the storage network or on a server. Included are local and remote replication products, migration tools, and disk imaging products. Also included are replication products specifically targeted as an alternative to backup applications. Not included are database replication products, log-based DBMS replication products or application-based replication products.

Data Runs

Non-resident attributes are stored in intervals of clusters called runs. Each run is represented by its starting cluster and its length. The runs map the VCNs of a file to the LCNs of a volume.

See also: Attribute, Cluster, LCN, VCN and Volume.

data synchronization

A form of embedded middleware that allows applications to update data on two systems so that the data sets are identical. These services can run via a variety of different transports but typically require some application-specific knowledge of the context and notion of the data being synchronized.

data warehouse

A storage architecture designed to hold data extracted from transaction systems, operational data stores and external sources. The warehouse then combines that data in an aggregate, summary form suitable for enterprisewide data analysis and reporting for predefined business needs. The five components of a data warehouse are production data sources, data extraction and conversion, the data warehouse database management system, data warehouse administration and business intelligence (BI) tools.

database design

This includes logical (entity relationship) and physical (table, column and key) design tools for data. Physical data modeling is becoming almost mandatory for applications using relational database management systems (RDBMSs). Strong support for physical modeling is paired with facilities to manage multiple models, to submodel or extract from larger models, and to reverse-engineer a database design from established tables. Data architects/analysts and database designers/administrators are the primary targeted users of these tools, although developers are a secondary market often targeted with a subset of the complete functionality.

DBMS (database management system)

A DBMS is a product used for the storage and organization of data that typically has defined formats and structures. DBMSs are categorized by their basic structures and, to some extent, by their use or deployment.

Included here are tools for monitoring and diagnosing problems with databases, analyzing and improving the performance of databases, and routine administration of databases, including configuration changes. Examples include database management monitors, SQL tuners, space tuners, reorganization tools, utilities, loaders and unloaders, and many other tools, as well as suites that may include several of the above.

DBS (direct broadcast satellite)

Type of satellite used for consumer services, primarily the transmission of radio and TV programs. A direct broadcasting satellite is similar to a fixed-service satellite (FSS); however, it offers a higher power output, requiring smaller antennas to receive the signal. Typical DBS services offer digital programming, digital audio services and, increasingly, high-definition TV (HDTV).

DDBMS (distributed database management system)

A DBMS that enables end users or application programmers to view a collection of physically separate databases as one logical single-system image. The concept that is most fundamental to the DDBMS is location transparency, meaning the user should not be conscious of the actual location of data.

DDL (data definition language)

A language used to describe the data model for a database, i.e., the names and access paths for the data and how they are interrelated. In some software products, the DDL describes the logical, not the physical, data. Other products use it to describe both.

Decimal

Maths carried out in base ten. In this documentation, numbers that are neither in hex, nor binary, are in decimal, e.g. 16 (sixteen), 23 (twenty-three).

See also: Binary, Hex and Units.

desktop outsourcing

Desktop outsourcing is a multiyear or annuity contract or relationship involving the day-to-day management responsibility for operating desktop/client platforms. Services include any combination (or all) of the product support and professional services as they specifically relate to the ongoing management of the desktop resources (including desktop peripherals). Minimally, desktop outsourcing contracts always include services encompassed by the computing environment of the operation services segment. Help desk management services are included only to the extent that problem determination and resolution is at the computing hardware level or the infrastructure software or OS software level. Application management services are included only to the extent of the infrastructure software or OS software level. A desktop system can include any client system (including a notebook) and may include the client systems of remote employees, such as telecommuters and mobile staff. Services may be provided at the client site or off-site. IT assets may be owned by either the client, the ESP or a third party. Contracts may include the transfer of client employees, IT assets and facilities to the ESP.

Desktop virtualization is not a single market category, but rather is made up of four distinct markets that address different requirements – virtualization software, hosted virtual desktops, application virtualization and portable personality solutions.

DEVA (document-enabled vertical application)

A concept that applies integrated document and output management (IDOM) technologies in specific industries for support of vertical (or sometimes horizontal) processes. Examples of industries and related processes include insurance (claims processing), engineering (technical document management), pharmaceuticals (new drug application), financial services (retirement processing) and cross-industry applications (call-center support).

development and integration services

Development and integration services support the implementation and rollout of new network infrastructure, including consolidation of established network infrastructure. Activities may include hardware or software procurement, configuration, tuning, staging, installation and interoperability testing.

The electronic data is processed to enable the image to be transferred to the photoconductor. The electronic image data is then transferred to a print engine, which may utilize a number of different technologies, such as laser, LED or solid ink.

digital dial tone

A term describing the combination of XML and Internet transport protocols – such as HTTP, SMTP and FTP – to create a ubiquitous capability to exchange structured information. The metaphor relies on the contrast between previous business to business (B2B) message exchanges – such as electronic data exchange (EDI) using X12, EDI for Administration, Commerce and Transportation (EDIFACT) and various vertical-industry-specific standards – and the unstructured communications media of telephone and fax. The former required considerable investment and the interposition of a private network – or substantial bilateral negotiation – to achieve interoperability, while the latter are ubiquitous and broadly interoperable. With the Internet and ubiquitous software to implement Internet transport protocols, business partners can reduce the cost, delay and risk of implementing B2B messaging.

Internet transport protocols by themselves do not constitute a complete digital-dial-tone solution. For secure application messaging to occur over the Internet, communicating systems must be programmed to additional specifications in key areas such as security, routing and access control. Ubiquity will not be achieved until integration products agree on standards for meeting these requirements.

digital divide

The gap in opportunities experienced by those with limited accessibility to technology, especially the Internet. This includes, but is not limited to, accessibility challenges in the following areas:

• Cultural (e.g., membership of a community that prohibits or restricts access to technology)
• Physical (e.g., having a disability that make it difficult or impossible to use a computer)
• Economic (e.g., being unable to afford a computer)
• Educational (e.g., not knowing how to use a computer)

digital forensics

Digital forensics is defined as the use of specialized, investigative techniques and technologies to determine whether illegal or otherwise inappropriate events have occurred on computer systems, and provide legally defensible information about the sequence of those events.

digital loopback

A technique for testing the digital processing circuitry of a communications device. It can be initiated locally or remotely via a telecommunications circuit; the device being tested will echo back a received test message (after first decoding and then re-encoding it) the results of which are compared with the original message.

digital modem

A system component that enables communication over digital access facilities with a remotely located system connected to the public network over analog facilities.

digital network

A network incorporating both digital switching and digital transmission.

digital signature

A core function of a public key infrastructure (PKI). A digital signature can prove identity because it is created with the private key portion (which only the key holder should access) of a public/private key pair. Anyone with the sender’s widely published public key can decrypt the signature and, by doing so, receive the assurance that the data must have come from the sender (nonrepudiation of the sender) and that the data has not changed (integrity). The data that is encrypted with the private key is not the entire message, but a short, fixed-length block of data that is computed from the message using a so-called “hash” function.

digital switching

The process of establishing and maintaining a connection under stored program control where binary-encoded information is routed between an input and an output port.

digitize

To convert or express an analog form in a digital format.

DIP (document image processing)

DIP (dual in-line package)

A method of packaging electronic components for mounting on printed circuit boards.

direct channel

This is a channel through which hardware, software and peripherals are sold by the manufacturer directly to the end user:

Direct sales force – This is a channel through which products move directly from the manufacturer or vendor to the end user, usually by a professionally trained field sales force.

Direct fax/phone/Web – This is a channel through which manufacturers sell their own products directly to end users through the use of the telephone, Web, fax, fax back and mail, including e-mail and catalog.

Direct retail – These are storefront operations owned and managed by the vendor, typically a manufacturer of computer systems. Direct stores are more common in Europe and Japan than in other parts of the world.

directed speech recognition

A system that uses a script-like dialog instead of complete, free-form natural language. For each question asked, there are a limited number of valid responses. With this approach, accuracy rates may go up dramatically on less-expensive hardware.

Directory

An NTFS directory is an index attribute. NTFS uses index attributes to collate file names. A directory entry contains the name of the file and a copy of the file’s standard information attribute (time stamp information). This approach provides a performance boost for directory browsing because NTFS does not need to read the files’ MFT records to print directory information.

directory services

Middleware that locates the correct and full network address for a mail addressee from a partial name or address. A directory service provides a naming service and extends the capabilities to include intelligent searching and location of resources in the directory structure.

“dirty” protocols

Many Internet Protocol (IP) applications assume that direct IP connectivity exists between hosts. In today’s Internet or extranets, this is often not true. The problems of limited IP address space have caused many enterprises to use private Request for Comment (RFC) 1918 addresses. These addresses cannot be routed and, for enterprises to connect to the Internet or to communicate in an extranet, address translations or application proxies must be used. For applications that exchange their IP addresses between the client and the server, these “dirty” IP address are not valid when one or both of the end systems exist on an RFC 1918 network. In addition, without using special techniques, applications like File Transfer Protocol (FTP) will not work when an enterprise uses private RFC 1918 addresses.

disciplined multisourcing

distributed data management

A form of client/server computing in which some portion of the application data executes on two or more computers.

distributed function

A form of client/server computing in which some of the application program logic executes on one computer, possibly with a database, and the rest of the application resides on another computer, possibly along with presentation services.

document management hardware services

This segment includes copier and printer services.

• Copier services – Copiers perform image capture and transfer. This category includes analog (optical technology) and digital (digital scanning and printing technology) copiers.
• Printer services – A printer is the peripheral output device of a computer system for producing computer-generated images on paper using various marking technologies. To be classified in this segment, the device needs to be capable of using plain or coated papers with a minimum size of International Organization for Standardization A4, U.S. size A (letter) or continuous forms with an 8-inch print width or greater, but it excludes products that support paper widths above A2 or U.S. size C (17 inches x 22 inches). The definition also excludes other classes of application-specific printers, such as point-of-sale printers, airline ticket printers, video printers and dedicated photo printers.

Technical standard that defines a complete air interface specification for two-way satellite broadband very small aperture terminal (VSAT) systems. The technology is being used as part of a low-cost VSAT system to provide highly dynamic, demand-assigned transmission capacity to residential and commercial/institutional users. DVB-RCS enables the near-equivalent speeds of asymmetric digital subscriber line or cable Internet connections without the need for local terrestrial infrastructure. Depending on satellite link budgets and other system design parameters, DVB-RCS-based systems can dynamically provide up to 20 Mbps to each terminal on the downlink, and up to 5 Mbps or more from each terminal on the uplink. The standard is published by ETSI as EN 301 790. See DVB Project and VSAT.

DVB-SH (digital video broadcasting – satellite services to handheld)

Transmission system standard designed to deliver video, audio and data services to small handheld devices via satellite using S-band frequencies. DVB-SH aims to take advantage of the characteristics of higher frequency S-band, where there is less congestion than in an ultrahigh frequency spectrum. DVB-SH’s key feature: it is a hybrid satellite/terrestrial system enabling the use of a satellite to achieve coverage of large regions or a whole country. In areas where direct reception of the satellite signal is not possible, a terrestrial gap filler system, such as an ATC system, can be used to provide coverage. DVB-SH systems are designed to use frequencies below 3GHz, typically around 2.2GHz. DVB began work on the DVB-SH specifications in 2006. The system and waveform specifications have been published as ETSI standards TS 102 585 and EN 302 583. See also DVB Project, DVB-H, ETSI, and S-band.

DVB-T (digital video broadcasting – terrestrial)

Standard used in Europe and Asia to transmit and decode digital television signals. North America, parts of Latin America and South Korea have adopted the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) standard. See also DVB-H.

DXC (digital cross-connect)

DXCs are used at major network nodes to cross-connect a number of inbound and outbound circuits. The cross-connecting of circuits is done when circuits are provisioned, but, typically, cross-connects are also used to implement various schemes for protection switching and network restoration. In the SDH market, the abbreviation “DXC” is used for digital cross-connects, whereas they are referred to as “DCSs” in the SONET world.

dye sublimation

An output device that prints one line at a time, using an electrically heated element to produce images. Instead of spraying jets of ink onto a page as inkjet printers do, dye sublimation printers apply a dye from a plastic film. This takes the form of a roll or a ribbon, similar to that used by thermal wax printers, usually containing consecutive panels of cyan, magenta, yellow and black dye.

EAM (enterprise asset management)

Evolving from computer(ized) maintenance management system applications that encompass work and material management for fault repair, regular preventive maintenance and service, EAM systems have been a key tool in asset care, maintenance, repair and overhaul. EAM applications are not limited to manufacturing; they also apply to utilities, facilities, transportation and other activities in which equipment subject to wear, failure or repair is used. EAM is a part of a strategy to increase plant capacity, using IT in lieu of new construction in large, asset-intensive enterprises. It integrates key plant control systems and ERP with maintenance activities and functions to reduce downtime and minimize maintenance spending. In its most complete form, EAM equates to an ERP solution for a nonmanufacturing environment, such as a utility, mining, defense or transportation operation. EAM functionality includes, but is not limited to:

• Record assets (asset management)
• Capital construction
• Planned maintenance of assets
• Reactive work management
• Disposal of assets
• Maintenance, repair and operations materials management
• Resource scheduling (people)
• Analytics and BI
• Condition monitoring
• Mobile workforce support
• Reliability-centered maintenance

EAP (extensible authentication protocol)

Extensible framework and transport for other network access authentication protocols. The original dial-up Point-To-Point Protocol (PPP) provided only basic security by using Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). EAP was added to support more-sophisticated authentication, particularly on wireless networks. See also Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP).

EAO (enterprise applications outsourcing)

EAO divides into four major domains: IT outsourcing (ITO), business process outsourcing (BPO), application service provider (ASP) and business service provider (BSP). Each domain reflects a different approach to outsourcing with respect to the degree of business responsibility transferred to the external services provider (ESP) and the autonomy of the enterprise in adjusting the application and business processes to its needs.

earth station

Collection of equipment installed on the earth’s surface that enables communications over one or more satellites. Earth stations consist of a reflector antenna (or parabolic dish), a feed system to send and receive the RF carrier, data handling equipment and mechanical tracking equipment to keep the satellite within the antenna’s data send/receive area. Earth stations are typically owned by the company receiving the data from the satellite network, thus must operate within certain specified parameters to maintain the network’s stability. Earth stations are part of a satellite network’s ground segment, which consists of all earth stations operating in a satellite system. These can be connected to the end user’s equipment directly or via a terrestrial network. See also antenna and satellite dish.

E-CRM involves using the Web to support CRM with the goal of driving consistency within all channels relative to sales, customer service and support (CSS) and marketing initiatives. It can support a seamless customer experience and maximize customer satisfaction, customer loyalty and revenue.

EDA (event-driven architecture)

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is an architectural style in which a component (or multiple components) in a software system executes in response to receiving one or more event notifications. An event is anything that happens, and an event object is a record of that event.

EDGE (enhanced data rates for global evolution)

Part of the 3GPP set of standards and based on GSM and shared media packet data, EDGE uses a different and more efficient modulation scheme: the eight-phase shift key (8-PSK), rather than the Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) modulation scheme used over the radio interface by GSM and GPRS. This enhanced modulation technique opens up more bandwidth per radio carrier or cell. EDGE supports peak data rates of up to 384 kbps per cell, assuming that all eight time slots are used and that one time slot is not reserved for signaling. As with GPRS, bandwidth is shared by all concurrent users operating in the same cell. EDGE requires higher radio signal quality than that found in an average GSM network before higher data throughput speeds can be reached. EDGE also provides enhanced GRPS capabilities for data using 8-PSK, and when fully integrated with adaptive multirate (AMR), EDGE 2 also provides superior voice capacity to the GSM network.

edge routers and switches

Edge aggregation routers and switches reside in the service provider’s point of presence at the edge of the service provider’s core network, where they aggregate diverse metropolitan and customer-facing ports for transport across the long-haul IP/MPLS backbone. They have variable switching capacity, because they can handle thousands of channelized TDM interfaces to Digital Signal Level 0 (DS-0) circuits and support the delivery of multiple IP services. They handle broadband aggregation, leased-line aggregation, Ethernet services aggregation, convergence and aggregation of multiple traffic types, advanced IP services and VPNs. They support the following service provider router protocols: WFQ, BGP-4, IS-IS, WRED, access control lists, MPLS VPN and IPsec. They have subscriber management, bandwidth management, IP switching and VPN provisioning capabilities. In addition, they support IP/MPLS and Layer 3 traffic aggregation.

e-discovery

E-discovery is the identification, preservation, collection, preparation, review and production of electronically stored information associated with legal and government proceedings. The e-discovery market is not unified or simple – significant differences exist among vendors and service providers regarding technologies, specialized markets, overall functionality and service offerings. Content and records management, information access and search, and e-mail archiving and retention technologies provide key foundations to the e-discovery function. More and more enterprises are looking to insource at least part of the e-discovery function, especially records management, identification, preservation and collection of electronic files. E-discovery technology can be provided as a stand-alone application, embedded in other applications or services, or accessed as a hosted offering.

EDL (Enterprise Definition Language)

EDL defines classes, which are user-specified groupings of storage objects based on a combination of node, path, file name, ownership or other filters. Classes are used to collect, analyze and manage storage resources by application, owner, location, node or some other installation-defined criteria.

E-learning is the use of Internet technology for learning outside of the classroom. E-learning suites are software solutions that enable automation, administration and training over the Internet. E-learning suites are integrated product collections that comprise learning management systems (LMSs), virtual classrooms, courseware and learning content management systems (LCMSs). An LMS is software that automates the training process and function and includes registration and administration tools, skills and records management, courseware access, and programming interfaces to packaged applications. An LCMS is an integrated set of technology that manages all aspects of learning content. This includes authoring or acquisition, content history, auditing, replacement, and deletion. An LCMS generally works in conjunction with an LMS.

electronic signature

A traceable e-mail or a biometric applied to a message. The biometric may be based on digitized handwriting (handwriting that is converted by cryptography into a digital signature) or a biometric (e.g., a fingerprint that can be combined with a hash or digest of the message to show the signer’s intent). The electronic signature cannot be removed and applied to other documents to forge a signature.

e-mail and collaboration-centric UC approach

This approach grew out of e-mail and Web conferencing solutions. Vendors have added IM and presence products to their portfolios. Other functionality that is becoming increasingly part of these solutions includes audio conferencing, videoconferencing and converged communications clients. The initial versions of the IM and presence products were separate. However, a high degree of integration across the portfolios has been a focus of these solutions, as have integrated voice over IP (VoIP) capabilities, which are typically offered as a “voice chat” option on the IM text-chat product. As more functionality and integration is added, these solutions are shifting toward the UC portfolio approach. Examples of these solutions include the initial versions of IBM’s Lotus Notes, Sametime and Quickr, as well as Microsoft’s Exchange and Live Communications Server (LCS).

e-mail and calendaring

Products in the e-mail and calendaring software market range from workgroups to global enterprise-class platforms. They offer e-mail and calendaring and, increasingly, are components within a larger collaborative platform. These products may also include an integrated directory capability.

e-mail security boundary

These are e-mail security boundary solutions (software, appliance or managed services) that scan or block inbound e-mail at the SMTP gateway for viruses, spam and malicious code. Increasingly, these boundary solutions may also scan outbound e-mail for compliance with internal policies.

EMS (enhanced messaging service)

Standard that uses some features defined in the Short Message Service (SMS) specification to enhance the user experience when sending messages. A thin client is added to the mobile phone and by using standard SMS parameter fields, such as the user data header, binary-encoded and concatenated messages can be sent that display enriched content, such as italicized, emboldened or underlined text, predefined sounds, monophonic tunes and static or animated images.

EMU (electronic messaging utility)

A concept describing a solid base of interworking electronic messaging provided as a utility service like electricity. The EMU is sturdy enough to bear the anticipated increase in number and size of messages, sufficiently generalized to ensure readability of attachments and well-connected to the world beyond the boundary of the enterprise. The EMU provides open interfaces to make its services available to end users and applications.

ENS (enterprise nervous system)

A term for the intelligent network that provides unifying connectivity among people, application systems and devices in different locations and business units across a virtual enterprise. The emerging ENS is based on the traditional enterprise network, but it is an evolution of that network, providing value-added functions that elevate the role of the network well beyond that of plain communication. Whereas a conventional network simply aims to transfer data between sending application systems and explicitly defined destinations, an ENS offloads work from the application systems because it:

• Offers enhanced quality-of-service for communication
• Transforms messages
• Redirects messages as appropriate, using logical business rules
• May track and control business processes

enterprise unified communications infrastructure

This domain encompasses server-based products and software that provide a central platform for communications for enterprises and other organizations. A key part of the UC proposition is the promise of a more consistent user experience across a wider range of communications channels and features. To achieve this, a critical task is to tightly integrate the server-based communications products and application functionality into a UC infrastructure. This domain is the key battlefield for infrastructure vendors with leadership aspirations in UC.

This domain emerges as a result of convergence in the established separate markets for telephony PBXs, e-mail and calendaring, voice mail, audioconferencing, Web conferencing and the more recent market for IM. It also encompasses some aspects of mobility applications, such as enterprise wireless e-mail software. In addition, we expect that new features and functions will emerge as important elements of an enterprise UC infrastructure portfolio. Examples include: rich presence server applications; multiparty videoconferencing functionality; and improved access to corporate communications features for mobile staff.

enterprise voice services revenue

Revenue from voice services provided to enterprise customers. Revenue comprises two main segments: calling revenue and connection revenue. These segments incorporate and combine public switched telephone network (PSTN) and voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) revenues, but do not split the revenue for each of these types of service.

The PSTN includes traditional telephone lines, both analog and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). In the latter case, each channel in use is equivalent to one voice line. A VoIP telephone connection is delivered over a dedicated or broadband access (which can include Session Initiation Protocol [SIP] trunks), connecting to an IP network or the Internet. A virtual line must come with a telephone number assigned for terminating PSTN calls to an IP or SIP phone, a soft-phone (PC), or IP-enabled time division multiplexing (TDM) phone. Details of the revenue segments are as follows:

• Connection Revenue: revenue associated with monthly recurring fees to connect to services. Included in this line are revenues from fixed monthly connection (or subscription) fees associated with providing a telephone line or connection, telephone number and related value-added services, such as calling line identification and voice mail. In most markets, the connection fee excludes calling charges, which are additional charges, based on usage volume. However, in some markets, the connection fee bundles unlimited calling or limited number of minutes. Under such circumstances, the connection revenue will be inflated, but the calling revenue will be smaller.
• Calling Revenue: revenue associated with individually tariffed outbound calling made from either a PSTN or VoIP connection, including any supplemental flat rate plans. This will include national and international long distance services. In some markets there are metered calling charges for local calls.

A device or card can hold multiple e-purse applications designed for specific uses (for example, an e-purse on a student card or device could be restricted to purchases at a bookstore).

Erlang

Unit of telecommunications traffic measurement giving the total volume of traffic during one hour. Cellular system capacity depends on the number of channels available for voice and data, the amount of traffic users generate and the grade of service offered to users. Telecommunication engineers use Erlang traffic formulas to understand traffic patterns and to design networks with sufficient capacity to avoid excessive blocked calls. Variations of the formulas are used for call center capacity planning. The unit is named after Danish telecommunications pioneer Agner Krarup Erlang, who first described the traffic volume formula in 1909.

ERP (enterprise resource planning)

Event management (as well as log management and fault management) tools are used to collect, report and help with diagnosis of problems (faults) identified in the environment. This segment also includes IT operations and administration “policy” software, which creates and manages lists of users (in cooperation with security and human resource management system products) and lists of the environment’s elements, determines appropriate access policies to those elements on a per-user or “role” basis, and audits adherence to those policies.

In cooperation with separate security products, event management/fault management products can recognize and trigger a response to breaches in security. Event management tools also collect statistics about events and usage, and they can perform historical trend analysis. System administrators can view analyzed data in near real time and use it to respond to conditions displayed, and to guide the reassigning of resources using separate configuration management (CM) tools.

e-wallet (electronic wallet)

Residing on a device or a server, this software application stores personal information (for example, passwords and shipping addresses), digital certificates and information for a variety of payment instruments (for example, credit cards or e-cash) used for e-commerce transactions.

femtocell

Smaller than picocells, these cellular base stations are designed for use in residential or corporate environments that connect to the customer’s broadband connection using an IP link. Advantages include lower cost than microcellular technology, physically smaller units and greater network efficiency. See also picocell.

FHMA (frequency-hopping multiple access)

Spread-spectrum transmission technology that enables simultaneous data or voice communications to share the same communication medium by causing transmitting and receiving stations to change the frequency rapidly in a pseudorandom sequence among many discrete radio channels. Transceivers are synchronized using a hopping sequence calculated from a predefined algorithm. This sequence can be adjusted dynamically to avoid other transmissions and interference in the same frequency band.

fiber optics

A high-bandwidth transmission technology that uses light to carry digital information. One fiber telephone cable carries hundreds of thousands of voice circuits. These cables, or light guides, replace conventional coaxial cables and wire pairs. Fiber transmission facilities occupy far less physical volume for an equivalent transmission capacity, which is a major advantage in crowded ducts. Optical fiber is also immune to electrical interference.

field service management software

These applications are designed within a CRM environment that enable field service technicians or dispatchers to diagnose problems categorically, identify the required parts and information, and dispatch them to the client or site. The system identifies the proper tools or materials required for the specific problem and their current location. It includes field service workforce schedule optimization, support for wireless mobile technicians and intelligent device management of equipment. Field service management ties into an overall service resource planning system that includes contract management, warranty, claims, parts management, depot repair, enterprise asset management (EAM) and product life cycle management (PLM) systems.

File

In the NTFS terminology, a file can be a normal file, directory (like in Linux) or a system file.

$FILE_NAME

This attribute represents the file’s name. A file can have one or more names, which can be in any directory. This is the NTFS equivalent to Unix’s hard links.

Filename Namespace

Not all characters are valid in DOS filenames. For compatibity NTFS stores which namespace the name belongs to.

File Permissions

NTFS supports the standard set of DOS file permissions, namely Archive, System, Hidden and Read Only. In addition, NTFS supports Compressed and Encrypted.

See also: $SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR and Compression

FILE Record

The $MFT is made up of FILE records, so named because of a magic number of FILE. Each record has a standard header and a list of attributes. If the attributes don’t fit into a single record, then more records will be used and a $ATTRIBUTE_LIST attribute will be needed.

See also: Attribute, Attribute List, Magic Number and $MFT.

File Record Segment (FRS)

FRS = MFT File Record

File Reference

Each file record has a unique number identifying it. The first 48 bits are a sequentially allocated number which is the offset in the $MFT. The last 16 bits are a sequence number. Every time the record is altered this number is incremented. The sequence number can help detect errors on the volume.

See also: File Record, $MFT and Volume.

File Runs (See Data Runs)

file server

A computer containing files available to all users connected to a local-area network (LAN). In some LANs, a microcomputer is designated as the file server, while in others it is a computer with a large disk drive and specialized software. Some file servers also offer other resources such as gateways and protocol conversion.

File Size

There are three file sizes that NTFS records. Each of them stores the number of bytes

R) Real. The number of bytes of data.
A) Allocated. The size taken up on disk.
I) Initialised. Size of compressed file.
If the file is compressed, the Initialised Size may be smaller than the Real Size.

Filesystem

The physical structure an operating system uses to store and organize files on a storage unit. A commonly used filesystem is FAT (used by DOS).

financial analytical applications

A subset of business intelligence with a specific emphasis on financial process, including, but not limited to, budgeting, forecasting, expense allocation and cost/revenue analysis.

financial footprint

The amount of money paid, monthly or yearly, to a vendor to support a particular system or application. Because most hardware and software is easily upgradable, financial-footprint management involves managing a stream of recurring payments instead of physical assets.

finished branded product

A completed equipment or device, labeled by a manufacturer that is available for sale to customers. The product can either be new or remanufactured.

finite loading

Conceptually, the term means putting no more work into a factory than the factory can be expected to execute. The term usually refers to a computer technique that involves automatic shop priority revision to level load operation by operation.

firewall

An application or an entire computer (e.g., an Internet gateway server) that controls access to the network and monitors the flow of network traffic. A firewall can screen and keep out unwanted network traffic and ward off outside intrusion into a private network. This is particularly important when a local network connects to the Internet. Firewalls have become critical applications as use of the Internet has increased.

first generation (1G or analog)

Wireless networks based on analog frequency division multiple access technologies. Many systems were individually tailored, country-specific solutions, including technologies such as AMPS, Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) and total access communications system (TACS). Although these were the first generation of mobile telephony, they are never referred to as “1G.”

fixed-line carrier

An entity that owns/operates a fixed-line network infrastructure (including fixed wireless).

fixed wireless

Client devices are located at a stationary location and usually require a fixed (main) power supply and an antenna external to the client work platform. The terms “nomadic,” “portable” and “mobile” often vary in definition when used by vendors. See also mobile wireless and semi-mobile wireless.

Fixup (See Update Sequence)

flexible media and conferencing switching

Flexible media and conferencing switching can be used by employees with intensive collaboration requirements. Flexible media and conferencing integrates with contextual presence lists, and communication between various teams and customers can be achieved via IM, audio conferencing, Web conferencing or e-mail.

flow

All activities being undertaken within the lean enterprise at an even rate without delays, interruptions or other batching.

FM (facilities management)

Entering into an agreement with a service supplier to manage internal company facilities such as telecommunications or data-processing services. Facilities management does not involve the transfer of ownership of facilities to the service provider.
For government enterprises, FM is the most prevalent type of contractual relationship where the vendor assumes responsibility for one or more information technology (IT) functions. Unlike outsourcing, it refers to the vendor operating and managing the assets (usually hardware and software), but not taking ownership. In a government-owned, contractor-operated deal, the government owns the equipment and operating systems, and the contractor operates the equipment with its personnel. Usually, the equipment is maintained in a government facility, but it can reside in a vendor-owned facility. In a government-owned, government-operated arrangement, the government owns the equipment and manages the operation using contractor personnel.

FM (frequency modulation)

One of three ways of modifying a sine wave signal to make it carry information. The sine wave or “carrier” has its frequency modified in accordance with the information to be transmitted. The frequency function of the modulated wave can be continuous or discontinuous.

FMC (fixed-mobile convergence)

Device and infrastructure technology trend that enables the transparent use of voice and data applications across fixed and mobile access points. See also fixed-mobile substitution (FMS).

Fork (See Resource Fork)

FP (function point)

Function points measure the size of an application system based on the functional view of the system. The size is determined by counting the number of inputs, outputs, queries, internal files and external files in the system and adjusting that total for the functional complexity of the system. Function point analysis, originally developed at IBM, has as an advantage its focus on measuring software produced in terms of functionality delivered to the end user, rather than in terms of development deliverables, which have no direct bearing on the end user.

FPD (flat panel display)

A core component for notebooks, liquid crystal display (LCD) flat panel displays are broadening their applications on the commercial desktops. There are five key FPD technologies available: LCD, gas plasma, electroluminescent (EL) display, field emission display and digital micromirror devices. The most mature is LCD, which includes active-matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) and passive-matrix liquid crystal display (PMLCD).

FPY (First Pass Yield)

A measure of quality in a process that reflects the percentage of product made correctly without any rework or corrective activity.

FR (frame relay)

An American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard (T1S1) for an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) packet-mode bearer service that defines a user-to-network interface. The two main benefits are bandwidth on demand and integrated access. The standard currently addresses data communications speeds up to 2 megabits per second (Mbps) over permanent virtual circuits. Frame relay transmits data packets at high speeds across a digital network encapsulated in a transmission unit called a frame. It requires a dedicated connection during the transmission period. It is used on wide area networks (WANS) and also in private network environments with leased lines over T-1 lines. Frame relay is faster than traditional networks, because it was designed for today’s reliable circuits and performs less rigorous error detection. When circuits are less reliable, a great deal of network traffic is dedicated solely to correcting errors.

Fragmented

(un)f file

FRS (See File Record Segment)

framework

A style guide that defines the look, feel and interoperability of software applications.

framing

A control procedure used with multiplexed digital channels, whereby bits are inserted so the receiver can identify the time slots allocated to each channel. Framing bits can also carry alarm signals indicating specific alarm conditions.

frequency

An expression of how frequently a periodic wave form or signal repeats itself at a given amplitude. It can be expressed in hertz (Hz), kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz), etc.

frequency band

The range of frequencies defined and dedicated to a particular type of service or radio technology; a frequency band is usually divided into a number of channels.

frequency reuse

Technique for using a specified range of frequencies more than once in the same radio system so that the total capacity of the system is increased without increasing its allocated bandwidth. Frequency reuse schemes require sufficient isolation among the signals that use the same frequencies so that mutual interference among them is controlled at an acceptable level. For satellites, frequency reuse can be achieved by using orthogonal polarization states for transmission and/or by using satellite antenna (spot) beams that serve separate, non-overlapping geographic regions. See also spot beam.

frontware

Software that runs on a client workstation to provide better end-user interfaces for application programs running elsewhere.

fsck

This is a utility to check and repair filesystems. Its name is an abbreviation of filesystem check.

FSS (fixed-service satellite)

Any satellite communication service among earth stations located at fixed geographic positions. Generally, the type of fixed satellite services provided by FSS operators include telephone calls, TV signals for broadcasting of programming content and Internet/data transmissions. FSS-based services typically operate from a completely different set of satellites from those for mobile, satellite-based services, such as satellite phones or mobile broadband. See also MSS.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

A Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) standard used to log onto a network, list directories and copy files. That is, it provides authentication of the user and lets users transfer files, list directories, delete and rename files on the foreign host, and perform wild-card transfers.

FTTH (fiber to the home)

FTTH includes fiber-optic access solutions designed for residential deployments. In FTTH networks, fibers are directly connected to individual homes or multitenant buildings. FTTH includes various flavors of both PONs and PTP Ethernet-based solutions. Fiber-to-the-node (FTTN) solutions where fibers are not installed all the way to the residential premises are not included in the FTTH segment. FTTN solutions are instead tracked according to the technology used in the last mile (typically VDSL). With FTTH solutions, the “in-house” connectivity may be based on fiber, coaxial cable, copper or wireless technologies. FTTH covers only the electronics associated with the FTTH rollouts; it excludes associated cabling and civil works.

FTTN (fiber to the node)

FTTP (fiber to the premises)

The term residential fiber to the premises (FTTP) refers to equipment used in fiber access deployments where fibers extend all the way to the end-user premises and the equipment is designed and optimized for use in residential applications. Equipment designed and optimized for fiber-to-the-business applications is not included – such equipment is included in the optical transport segment.

FTTP is further divided into point-to-point (PTP) FTTP and point-to-multipoint FTTP. PTP FTTP technologies are more expensive to deploy because of a higher fiber count, but have the advantage of offering a dedicated fiber to each end-user location, which makes it possible to share PTP infrastructure between different carriers. Very often, a PTP FTTP deployment has optical Ethernet switches both at the CO and the customer premises.

Point-to-multipoint FTTP technology is commonly referred to as passive optical network (PON) technology. There are various types, including broadband PON (BPON), gigabit PON (GPON) and Ethernet PON (EPON). GPON is the most popular for large carriers, although there are significant EPON deployments in Asia/Pacific and Japan. The different types of PON are collectively called xPON.

FTTP, FTTH, fiber to the x (FTTx) and other similar terms are often used interchangeably in literature on this topic.

fuel cell

Technology for low-cost miniature battery power supplies. As with batteries, fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction. However, fuel cells are recharged by refilling or replacing the chemicals (examples include hydrogen, methyl alcohol or aluminum mixed with oxygen from the air) instead of plugging a charger into a wall socket. Fuel cells deliver energy density many times that of lithium and can power sophisticated devices longer. Choosing a stable fuel source that is safe and readily available and decreasing the size for smaller devices while maintaining efficiency remain challenges.

fuzzy logic

This reasoning paradigm deals with approximate or imprecise information by enabling variables to be described (often linguistically) and acted upon in terms of their degree of membership in predetermined sets. Control systems in electronic equipment and consumer products and other embedded control systems are among the most popular applications.

G

gain sharing

Describes a contract that defines the vendor’s contribution to the customer in terms of specific benefits to the customer’s business. Such a contract also defines the payment the customer will make according to the vendor’s performance in delivering those business benefits. Gain-sharing contracts require the development of a delivery paradigm that links a customer’s business metrics to a vendor’s IT solution. The key elements of this paradigm, in order, are:

Business metric definition and selection
Client metric benchmarking
Development of key performance indicators
Investment options evaluation
Gain-sharing contract development
Financial engineering
Delivery of services
Re-evaluation and adjustment of metrics

Galileo

A planned Global Positioning Satellite System (GPSS) of 30 low-earth orbit satellites backed by the European Union and the European Space Agency and originally due for commercial operation in 2008. Galileo was delayed by funding problems, because private enterprise had showed little interest. The European Parliament agreed with the Council of Europe in November 2007 to finance the deployment entirely from European Union funds, and after a validation phase due for completion in 2010, the service is now scheduled to go into operation in 2013. Galileo will complement the U.S. Government’s GPS system, which ran into problems with development delays for replacement satellites. The Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) has been guaranteed funding through 2009 and is being expanded to provide worldwide coverage with the launch of additional satellites during 2009.

GAN (generic access network)

Previously known as unlicensed mobile access (UMA), this is a network architecture designed to support seamless connectivity between wide-area cellular networks, such as GSM/GPRS, and LAN technologies, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth – it is an example of fixed-mobile convergence. See also FMC.

gateway

A computer that sits between different networks or applications. The gateway converts information, data or other communications from one protocol or format to another. A router may perform some of the functions of a gateway. An Internet gateway can transfer communications between an enterprise network and the Internet. Because enterprises often use protocols on their local-area networks (LANs) that differ from those of the Internet, a gateway will often act as a protocol converter so that users can send and receive communications over the Internet.
A product or feature that uses proprietary techniques to link heterogeneous systems.

gateway server

A server designed to transform data streams to better match device capabilities. For example, Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) gateway servers convert HTML to Wireless Markup Language (WML) for wireless devices, and a number of products can reformat HTML for devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Today, HTML-based servers predominate. While HTML can be made aware of a unique device requesting content, more often “shadow” Web server applications are created to draw off and reformat the native content.

gateway (transcoding) server

Server designed to transform data streams to better match device capabilities. For example, Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) gateway servers convert HTML to Wireless Markup Language (WML) for wireless devices, and a number of products can reformat HTML for devices such as mobile phones and PDAs. Today, HTML-based servers predominate. HTML can be made aware of a unique device requesting content; however, more often, “shadow” Web server applications are created to draw off and reformat native content.

A global delivery model is defined as “the optimum combination of processes, end-to-end methodologies and quality procedures, with high-quality skills and resources available internally or externally, in requisite quantities, on a global basis, that enables organizations to maximize the quality of their solutions while minimizing the overall cost and delivery time of their IT services.”

GPO (group purchasing organization)

An organization that provides collective buying service negotiations for its aggregate members with distributors and manufacturers of medical supplies.

GPS (global positioning system)

Describes a technology as well as an existing satellite system for assessing the location of any compatible receiver unit, using satellites to provide 24-hour positioning information regardless of the weather. GPS works on the principle of triangulation; by knowing its distance from three or more satellites, the receiver can calculate its position. The term most commonly refers to the satellite constellation provided by the U.S. government for military and widespread civilian use. This system will be complemented and possibly superseded by the Galileo System of 30 satellites, backed by the European Union and the European Space Agency, which is due for commercial operation in 2013. Russia operates an equivalent GPS known as GLONASS. See also LBS.

granularity

The ability to increase a system’s capacity and performance through incremental processor expansion.

gross new connections

Total number of new connections to a network in a given year.

ground segment

All earth stations and network operation centers on the ground that comprise a particular satellite communications system or network. The ground segment can be connected to an end user’s equipment directly or over a terrestrial network.

groupware

Software that supports interpersonal processes and the objects with which people commonly work. Groupware was originally coined to describe a new class of applications designed to provide electronic support for groups of individuals working together toward a common goal. The term has been applied to applications ranging from unstructured electronic mail to rigorously structured workflow systems. Groupware is more useful as a concept when it is broken down into three major stages: communication, coordination and cooperation. In this light, groupware applications can be viewed in terms of the degree of structure in the group interaction and in the complexity of that structure, and the rigor with which the activity itself is monitored.

GRX (GPRS roaming eXchange)

Standard defined by the GSM association that enables customers to access GPRS data services while roaming away from their home network.

G.SHDSL (global standard high-bit-rate DSL)

Global standard high-bit-rate DSL (G.SHDSL) offers data rates of up to 2.31 Mbps over a single copper pair and up to 4.6 Mbps over two pairs.

GSM (global system for mobile communications)

Digital cellular phone system standard that originated in Europe and extends to 860 networks in 220 countries and territories. GSM uses a TDMA radio propagation scheme. In Europe and Asia/Pacific, GSM has been deployed at 900MHz and 1,800MHz, with 1,900MHz most common in North America (see also GSM900, GSM1800 and GSM 1900). Multi-frequency handsets are available that support international roaming among these standards.

GSM900

GSM system operating in the 900MHz frequency band. In many GSM900 countries, GSM1800 also has been deployed to support additional operators or additional capacity. Therefore, most handsets in these countries are dual-band.

GSM1800

GSM system operating in the 1,800MHz frequency band. The standard previously was referred to as DCS 1800.

GSM1900

GSM system operating in the 1,900MHz frequency band. This variant of GSM technology is deployed widely in North America. GSM 800, a GSM variant for 800MHz frequencies, has been deployed, but not widely.

GSM anywhere

An initiative, supported by ETSI, to provide GSM network functionality using frequencies outside the 900MHz, 1,800MHz and 1,900MHz allocations. An example is the reuse of analog cellular phone frequencies in the 450MHz band in Scandinavian countries.

guard interval

GUI (graphical user interface)

A graphics-based operating system interface that uses icons, menus and a mouse (to click on the icon or pull down the menus) to manage interaction with the system. Developed by Xerox, the GUI was popularized by the Apple Macintosh in the 1980s. At the time, Microsoft’s operating system, MS-DOS, required the user to type specific commands, but the company’s GUI, Microsoft Windows, is now the dominant user interface for personal computers (PCs).

A comprehensive GUI environment includes four components: a graphics library, a user interface toolkit, a user interface style guide and consistent applications. The graphics library provides a high-level graphics programming interface. The user interface toolkit, built on top of the graphics library, provides application programs with mechanisms for creating and managing the dialog elements of the windows, icons, menus, pointers and scroll bars (WIMPS) interface.

The user interface style guide specifies how applications should employ the dialog elements to present a consistent, easy-to-use environment (i.e., “look and feel”) to the user. Application program conformance with a single user interface style is the primary determinant of ease of learning and use, and thus, of application effectiveness and user productivity.

GUID (See Units)

Included are e-mail, database, file, IM, BlackBerry and SharePoint archiving products.

High Performance File System (HPFS)

The OS/2 filesystem. Remember: once upon a time, OS/2 had to be the operating system developed by both IBM and Microsoft. There was a break between the 2 giants. IBM continued to develop OS/2 (it became OS/2 Warp), and that explains why OS/2 knows how to execute Windows applications. Microsoft decided to make its own operating system: Windows NT. HPFS design influenced NTFS design, so the 2 filesystems share many features.

highlight color

A two-color printing scheme found in some transactional documents, such as bills and statements. Black is the first color. The second color is used for emphasis or to highlight important information, such as the due date. The second color can also be used to match the corporate color scheme, in which the company name, logo or other elements are printed. Highlight color devices are classified as “monochrome” in the market data and forecast estimates it publishes.

When no clear HCM strategy is in place, business leaders formulate departmental plans and adopt the technologies they feel they need to support individual and group responsibilities for enterprise performance.

HRMS (human resource management system)

Business applications for the management of HR-related transactions, best practices and enterprise reporting. Functions typically include core HR tracking, payroll and benefits. The scope is often extended to include recruiting, competency management, training, time management, performance management and self-service offerings.

HSDL (high-speed subscriber data line)

A local phone line with full-duplex TI capabilities. As corporate intranets grow, bigger “pipes” are needed to maintain network performance. The use of inverse multiplexers that combine multiple E1 circuits will be the best way to deliver that bandwidth between the user site and the carrier’s central office. But the use of HSDL technology, as an alternative to inverse multiplexing of E1 circuits, will be a “dark horse” alternative to inverse multiplexing. Unlike inverse multiplexing, HSDL would require new support systems and maintenance procedures.

HSM (hierarchical storage management)

A storage management technology that can be used to identify inactive data and move it to near-line storage, automate the retrieval process, and migrate the data back to the primary storage medium and provide access for the user.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

A document-formatting language derived from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), predominately used to create Web pages. The user’s browser interprets HTML commands and formats the page layout, fonts and graphics on the screen. One of the more powerful features of HTML is its ability to create hyperlinks that enable the user to navigate between documents and files with a single click. HTTP is also sometimes used for messaging attachments as a way of supporting rich text formatting across product boundaries.

HTML that is generated by a program or service is considered “dynamically generated HTML,” which has been confused with the Netscape and Microsoft technology called dynamic HTML (DHTML). These technologies offer client-side mechanisms for enhancing the capabilities of the Web browser and HTML documents. Dynamically generated HTML might contain DHTML, but they are not the same thing.

hub

A central device, usually in a star topology local-area network (LAN), to which each station’s wiring is attached. Also called wiring concentrator. See intelligent hub.

HUD (head-up display)

A generic term for a display for which the user does not have to change his/her normal viewing position to see it. Personal head-up displays, for example, use optics mounted near the eye (on eyeglasses or a headset) to project the screen image. Although the physical display is small, the user has the illusion of watching a larger screen several feet away from the eye. This can be delivered as a display that blocks the user’s vision or one that superimposes the computer image over the user’s view of the real world.

hybrid thinking

The concept of hybrid thinking is defined as an organic discipline for taking on wicked problems by iteratively implementing transformative, innovative, and strategic change via the co-creative exploration of human-centered experiences that are culturally meaningful, technically feasible, and economically sustainable.

ILTC (instructor-led training in the classroom)

The most common form of training. It uses lecture sessions and discussions to convey information. It is most commonly used for briefings and high-level education, but many commercial training courses also use this method.

IM (information management)

A method of using technology to collect, process and condense information with a goal of efficient management. Most large enterprises have a central IM function to facilitate this coordination. The primary technologies needed are contained in a set of modeling tools that either have or interface to a production-worthy repository where the information is stored and managed. The repository and tools must be capable of receiving information in a “top-down,” “bottom-up” or “middle-out” evolutionary manner.

IM (instant messaging)

IM is a communications service in which short messages appear in pop-up screens as soon as they are received, thereby commanding the recipient’s immediate attention. Most IM services offer presence information that indicates if the user is online and available to send and receive messages. These services also provide “buddy lists” that are groups of people who have been selected by the user for frequent access, as well as group-based chat services. Enterprise IM provides real-time message passing within private and public networks.

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)

A protocol used to access e-mail or bulletin board messages from a (possibly shared) mail server. IMAP allows a client e-mail program to access remote message stores as if they were local. E-mail stored on an IMAP server can be manipulated from a workstation at the office, a desktop computer at home or a notebook computer while traveling, without requiring the transfer of messages or files back and forth between these computers. Details of the IMAP specification can be found at www.imap.org.

IMEI (international mobile equipment identifier)

indirect channel

This is a channel through which independent third-party organizations resell products. In software markets, value-added resellers (VARs) and system integrators are two typical examples of the indirect channel:

• Dealer – This is a group of resellers including independent, regional and national organizations that normally sell products and services to the business, education and government sectors. Client meetings are typically scheduled ahead of time and are most often solicited by an outbound sales force. Dealers usually provide a low level of service, training and customer assistance, and other value-added services.
• Vendor-specific agent – This is a reseller dedicated to selling one vendor’s products. The reseller store will carry the logo and products of that vendor but is not owned by the vendor (for example, some Xerox copier resellers in the U.S.).
• Indirect fax/phone/Web – This is a channel through which resellers sell a variety of products to end users through the use of the telephone, Web, fax, fax back and mail, including catalog sales. This is different from the direct fax/phone/Web channel in that the products are sold by resellers rather than direct from the vendor.
• VAR – This is a reseller that usually is not a storefront operation and typically acts as a consultant to clients. To qualify as a VAR, a reseller must have developed or configured some type of software package targeted at a particular market or offer significant integration expertise to the customer.
• VARs typically generate 40% or more of their revenue from custom products, service and support. VARs do not apply their label to the product and may not own the hardware or software.
• System integrators – These are system vendors and independent service providers that supply professional services to apply, migrate and integrate technology into business processes.
• Hosting and application service providers – These providers offer access to software over a network and may not include customization services.

INDX Record

Index records are used by directories, $Quota, $Reparse and $Secure. The contents depend on the type of index being kept. Directories store $FILE_NAME attributes.

See also: Directory, $I30, $Quota, $Reparse and $Secure.

Infinite Logging Area

Something contained in $LogFile. It consists of a sequence of 4KB log records.

See also: $LogFile

information access with search

Information access technologies interact with applications such as document management, Web content management and other repositories to provide users with insight into their content. Increasingly, information access technology is also expected to include results from enterprise applications, such as CRM and legacy systems. In addition, it looks outside enterprises to access Internet-based content. Information access technology is often acquired as an embedded aspect of other applications, and portal, ECM, business application and other vendors frequently include enterprise search as part of their products.

The first and most mature information access technology is search engine technology. It is typically applied to unstructured data in document repositories. It includes both enterprise and desktop search. Increasingly, automatic categorization, creative visualization, content analytics and taxonomy support technologies are being added to this category.

information architecture

All the sources of information – including paper, graphics, video, speech and thought – that define the enterprise are represented by this layer of applications architecture. It also defines the sources and destinations of information, its flow through the enterprise, as well as the rules for persistence, security and ownership.

information (knowledge) assets

Information relevant to an enterprise’s business function, including captured and tacit knowledge of employees, customers or business partners; data and information stored in highly-structured databases; data and information stored in textual form and in less-structured databases such as messages, e-mail, workflow content and spreadsheets; information stored in digital and paper documents; purchased content; and public content from the Internet or other sources.

information/data governance

Information governance is the specification of decision rights and an accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in the valuation, creation, storage, use, archival and deletion of information. It includes the processes, roles, standards and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals.

information delivery

• Reporting – Reporting provides the ability to create formatted and interactive reports, with highly scalable distribution and scheduling capabilities. In addition, BI platform vendors should handle a wide array of reporting styles (for example, financial, operational and performance dashboards).
• Dashboards – This subset of reporting includes the ability to publish formal, Web-based reports, with intuitive displays of information, including dials, gauges and traffic lights. These displays indicate the state of the performance metric compared with a goal or target value. Increasingly, dashboards are used to disseminate real-time data from operational applications.
• Ad hoc query – This capability, also known as self-service reporting, enables users to ask their own questions of the data, without relying on IT to create a report. In particular, the tools must have a robust semantic layer to allow users to navigate available data sources. In addition, these tools should offer query governance and auditing capabilities to ensure that queries perform well.
• Microsoft Office integration – In some cases, BI platforms are used as a middle tier to manage, secure and execute BI tasks, but Microsoft Office (particularly Excel) acts as the BI client. In these cases, it is vital that the BI vendor provides integration with Microsoft Office, including support for document formats, formulas, data “refresh” and pivot tables. Advanced integration includes cell locking and write-back.

infrastructure software

This segment includes AD and application integration and middleware (AIM) software, information management software, storage management software, IT operations management and security software, and other infrastructure software.

• Application development and AIM software services – The AD software market comprises tools that represent each phase of the software development life cycle (application life cycle management [ALM], design, construction, automated software quality and other AD software). The Application Infrastructure and Middleware market segment includes business process management (BPM)-enabling technologies, integration-enabling middleware, platform middleware, portals and Web 2.0 infrastructure, and various additional products grouped together as “other AIM.” Integration-enabling middleware is software that enables independently designed applications, software components or services to work together, by supporting data consistency, composite application and multi-step process styles of integration.
• Information management software services – This software market is defined by Data Management and Integration software and includes Data Integration Tools, Data Quality Tools and Database Management Systems. The discipline of data integration comprises the practices, architectural techniques and tools for achieving the consistent access and delivery of data across the spectrum of data subject areas and data structure types in the enterprise to meet the data consumption requirements of all applications and business processes. Traditionally aligned with cleansing of customer data (names and addresses) in support of CRM-related activities, the tools have expanded well beyond such capabilities, and forward-thinking organizations are recognizing the relevance of these tools in other data domains. A database management system (DBMS) is a product used for the storage and organization of data that typically has defined formats and structures. DBMSs are categorized by their basic structures and, to some extent, by their use or deployment.
• Storage management software services – The storage management software market includes all software products that are sold as value-added options to run on a server, storage network device or storage device to aid in managing the device or managing and protecting the data. Storage management software represents all the tools needed to manage capacity, performance and availability of data stored on disks, tapes and optical devices, as well as the networking devices that the data may pass through.
• IT operations management and security software services – IT operations management (ITOM) software is intended to represent all the tools needed to manage the provisioning, capacity, performance and availability of the computing, networking and application environment. Security software is included to control and monitor access to internal and external IT resources.
• Other infrastructure software services – Other infrastructure software includes, but is not limited to, clustering and remote control software, directory servers, OS tools, Java license fees, mainframe infrastructure, and mobile and wireless infrastructure, as well as other infrastructure software.
• Operating system software – An OS is software that, after being loaded into the computer by an initial boot program, manages a computer’s resources, controlling the flow of information into and from a main processor. OSs perform complex tasks, such as memory management, control of displays and other input/output peripheral devices, networking and file management, and other resource allocation functions between software and system components. The OS provides the foundation on which applications, middleware and other infrastructure components function. OS usually provides user interfaces, such as command-line shell and GUI, for interaction between user and computer. The four most common subcategories of operating systems include Linux, Unix, Windows and mainframe OS.

Inode

An inode is the filesystems representation of a file, directory, device, etc. In NTFS every inode it represented by an MFT FILE record.

See also: Directory, File, FILE Record and Filesystem

integrated software

A business software productivity program that incorporates a number of applications (typically word processing, database management, spreadsheet, graphics and communications) into one product, allowing data sharing between all or most modules.

integration

Integration services are detailed design and implementation services that link application functionality (custom software or package software) and/or data with each other or with the established or planned IT infrastructure. Specific activities might include project planning, project management, detailed design or implementation of application programming interfaces, Web services, or middleware systems.

integration appliances

An integration appliance can be regarded as a combination of hardware and software that fulfills a specific integration purpose, such as enabling the partially predefined integration of certain applications together with new ones. It is not uncommon to see packaged integration, packaged processes, and SOA governance mechanisms and technologies alongside traditional appliance technologies, such as acceleration, transformation, XML parsing and security features, such as firewalls and packet inspection. An appliance can be regarded as one type of deployment mechanism, along with the more traditional packaged software, SaaS and hosted models.

intellectual property

Intellectual property traditionally includes assets that are protected through regulatory methods such as patents, copyrights and regulatory licenses; however, this protection is being expanded to include software and business processes when these can be demonstrated to be original, novel and non-obvious. Customer intelligence and business intelligence may be considered intellectual “property” by its owner, depending on its value to enterprise competitiveness and its integration into business processes.

Internet

A loose confederation of independent yet interconnected networks that use the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocols for communications. The Internet evolved from research done during the 1960s on a network called the ARPANet. It provides universal connectivity and three levels of network services: connectionless packet delivery, full-duplex stream delivery, and application-level services.

Internet telephony

Term used to describe packetized IP voice traffic sent over the Internet (as distinct from a private or managed IP telecommunications infrastructure). When used to enable Internet telephony from a PC, it requires client software on the PC such as Skype, plus a broadband connection with minimal latency. See also IP telephony and VoIP.

interoperability

The ability for a device from one manufacturer to work with one from another.

intranet

A network internal to an enterprise that uses the same methodology and techniques as the Internet. It is not necessarily connected to the Internet and is commonly secured from it using firewalls. Intranets often use an organization’s local-area networks (LANs) or wide-area networks (WANs). Services include Web sites, collaboration, workflow and messaging services, and applications development.

I/O (input/output)

The activity of sending information to or from peripheral devices, terminals, direct-access storage devices (DASDs), tape drives and printers. Physical I/O performance lags behind that of memory and logical technologies.

I/O bound

Refers to programs with a large number of I/O (input/output) operations, which slow the central processing unit (CPU).

I/O channel

Equipment forming part of the input/output system of a computer. Under the control of input/output (I/O) commands, the channel transfers blocks of data between main storage and peripherals.

IP (Internet Protocol)

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) tracks the address of nodes, routes outgoing messages, and recognizes incoming messages. Current networks consist of several protocols, including IP, Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), DECnet, AppleTalk, Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) and LLC2. This wide diversity of protocols results from application suites that assume their own particular protocols. Collapse from this wide variety is inevitable, but users will only be able to reduce this diversity, not eliminate it. Most users will collapse networks into two main protocols: IP and IPX. Installed-base applications and the pain of change will prevent a total reduction to a single backbone protocol.

IPA (integrated publishing architecture)

A concept that defines the creation, assembly and production functions to support the complete document life cycle. Creation includes document component modeling, authoring, content identification, revision, review and approval; assembly includes document aggregation modeling, on-demand document construction and database interchange; and production includes composition, layout and file formatting for multiple communication channels.

IP address (Internet Protocol address)

A unique number assigned by an Internet authority that identifies a computer on the Internet. The number consists of four groups of numbers between 0 and 255, separated by periods (dots). For example, 195.112.56.75 is an IP address.

IP Centrex platforms

IP Centrex platforms offer a broad range of PBX replacement and new services. These products typically work with a variety of end-user devices and interfaces, including analog and digital phones, IP desktop phones, PDAs and mobile phones, all of which are widely used in enterprises.

These platforms offer a wide variety of enhanced features, such as: unified messaging (including visual voice mail); click to talk; enhanced find-me/follow-me capabilities; Microsoft Outlook integration, with “click to call” features; the ability to return calls and voice mail from a browser; Web-based call management to monitor and control service features and capabilities; automatic call distribution capabilities; selective call acceptance; collaborative applications; presence management; and instant messaging.

IP datacasting

IP datacasting uses DVB-H technology to transmit digital multimedia data to mobile devices in the form of IP datagrams. Content can be optimized for mobile handsets by adapting it to their small screens.

IP-enabled PBX

A customer-premises telephone switching system that has native IP switching and a TDM switching matrix, each delivering call-processing features and functions transparently between internal extensions (stations), whether the endpoint is an IP or traditional device. Typically, an IP-enabled product starts life as a traditional PBX, but is further developed to include IP capabilities. The traditional TDM switching matrix remains a part of the architecture, but a server-based processor capable of delivering voice traffic via packet switching has been added.

IP-enabled PBX/KTS IP extension line

A line attached to an IP-enabled PBX phone system that terminates with an IP phone or voice endpoint.

IP-enabled PBX/KTS traditional extension line

A line attached to an IP-enabled PBX phone system that terminates with a digital or an analog (non-IP) phone set.

IP extension line

A line that terminates with an IP phone or voice endpoint that was shipped, installed, and in use and attached to an IP-enabled PBX or IP-PBX phone system.

IP multimedia subsystem session control layer

IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a standardized, open architecture based on SIP and the Diameter authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) protocol. IMS defines how applications and services are delivered to customers, regardless of which network they run on. It separates session control from the actual applications for maximum flexibility, and can be used for centralized user profiles. It helps carriers to control sessions and provides the ability to charge for applications.

In addition to voice switching, control and applications carriers are also deploying data and video control layers, and IMS multimedia. They are also building more nimble and agnostic service layers with architectures such as NG service delivery platforms (SDPs). This area includes, for example, deployments of IP television (IPTV) and video overlays, as well as service enablers such as presence, instant messaging (IM)/chat, third-party exposure and application stores. The area is often associated with Telco 2.0.

IP-PBX

A LAN-based IP switching communications system that provides telephony functions employing voice IP endpoint connectivity. At least 95% of lines on pure IP PBX systems must terminate with IP voice endpoints.

IP seat license

A telephony seat that is in use and part of an IP-enabled PBX or IP-PBX phone system that terminates with an IP phone.

IPTV

IPTV refers to the use of a carrier-based managed IP broadband network to deliver television and video content services to an end user’s TV set via a set-top box (STB), with picture quality at least equivalent to existing pay-TV and free-to-air services. Content delivered over the Internet or only to a PC is excluded from our definition of the IPTV market. Our definition of IPTV includes all video content – whether broadcast-style pay-TV, video-on-demand (VOD) or other interactive video services. IPTV customers can search channel guides and select programs through an electronic program guide (EPG) on their TV screen. EPGs have varying degrees of functionality, depending on the service provider.

The typical IPTV model involves both broadcast pay-TV and on-demand services. Most IPTV providers offer both, though it is multichannel pay-TV that remains the key selling point in most services – and that generates most of the revenue. As a result, many IPTV services still have a strong focus on competing in a like-for-like manner against existing pay-TV services such as cable TV and direct-to-home (DTH) satellite offerings, often with similar packages of channels. Although this will change as new functionality is made available to IPTV users, it means that multichannel TV will be the foundation of IPTV offerings for several years.

iPhone

Apple’s mobile device that combines an iPod music and video player, mobile phone and Internet browser capability in a handheld unit with a touchscreen interface. An iPhone designed for EDGE cellular networks was launched in North America in June 2007 and in Europe in late 2007. A 3G-capable version was launched in July 2008.

IP-service control points

An IP-SCP is a carrier-grade application server using industry-standard hardware, operating systems, open standards and protocols. The application server normally incorporates a real-time database and service logic execution functionality (also known as call triggers via a service switching point [SSP]), facilitating applications. The application server includes provisioning interfaces.

IP telephony

The term used for LAN-attached telephony systems and the associated telephone handsets (that is, the IP version of the PBX). More specifically, IP telephony involves the delivery of the telephony application (for example, call setup and teardown, and telephony features) over IP, instead of using circuit-switched or other modalities. IP telephony is not the same as VoIP or Internet telephony, although the terms are commonly (and erroneously) used interchangeably. See also Internet telephony and VoIP.

IRD (integrated receiver decoder)

Official name for the signal reception system that receives and converts modulated signals back into their original format suitable for presentation to an end-user device or display. IRDs typically contain a built-in decoder for unscrambling subscription TV programming channels. It is also known as a satellite receiver or satellite set-top box.

irDA (Infrared Data Association)

Maintains a standard for infrared data transmission (up to 4 Mbps). Because this technology’s cost is extremely low, it is now embedded in many consumer electronic devices (for example, laptop computers and handheld devices, such as PDAs and cellular phones).

IRR (internal rate of return)

IRR analysis determines the interest rate and then compares this rate to the “risk-adjusted rate of return.”

ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network)

A technical standard and design philosophy for digital networks. ISDN provides high-speed, high-bandwidth channels to every subscribers on the public switched telephone network, achieving end-to-end digital functions with standard equipment interface devices. ISDN networks enable a variety of mixed digital transmission services to be accommodated at a single interface.

ISO (International Organization for Standardization)

A voluntary, nontreaty organization established in 1949, as a technical agency of the United Nations, to promote international standardization in a broad range of industries. ISO’s Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model establishes guidelines for network architectures.

ISO (Internet sales outlet)

A third-party Web site that attracts visitors looking to buy goods or services. ISOs make money by selling links or ads that lead directly to Web merchant sites or by selling products or services on behalf of Web merchants.

ISO 9000

The international standard for quality control. It is also known as BS5750 and EN29001. The three standards are identical, but they are numbered and published differently by different standards bodies. The worldwide standard is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and is the one generally referenced. ISO 9000 is a generic standard that any enterprise or individual department can use. It is not specific to the IT industry. The standard is subdivided into three – ISO 9001, ISO 9002 and ISO 9003. Enterprises use some or all of the parts, depending on the nature of their business. Any enterprise can claim that it complies with ISO 9000. To make the claim credible, an external assessor from an accreditation body must evaluate the enterprise’s quality system. ISO 9000 certification does not guarantee quality; it guarantees consistency of approach.

ISP (Internet service provider)

A company that provides Internet access to its customers. The majority of ISPs are too small to purchase access directly from the network access point (NAP), and instead buy pieces of bandwidth that are available from larger ISPs. Access to the Internet can be provided either via modem or by direct connection, which offers far higher speeds.

Internet service providers are different from online services, although these services sometimes also provide access to the Internet. Online services provide access to exclusive content, databases and online discussion forums that are not available outside the service.

ISV (independent software vendor)

A software producer that is not owned or controlled by a hardware manufacturer; a company whose primary function is to distribute software. Hardware manufacturers that distribute software (such as IBM and Unisys) are not ISVs, nor are users (such as banks) that may also sell software products.

ISVs typically offer products that the primary vendor (i.e., IBM) does not offer, allowing clients of that vendor to round out their software needs. ISVs create price competition and also increase the pace of technology innovation in their markets.

IT (information technology)

This is the common term for the entire spectrum of technologies for information processing, including software, hardware, communications technologies and related services. In general, IT does not include embedded technologies that do not generate data for enterprise use.

ITAM (IT asset management)

A systematic approach to managing IT assets, including information systems (IS) department staff, end users performing IT support, technology procurement teams, suppliers, facilities, hardware and software.

IT consulting

IT consulting services are advisory services that help clients assess different technology strategies and, in doing so, align their technology strategies with their business or process strategies. These services support customers’ IT initiatives by providing strategic, architectural, operational and implementation planning. Strategic planning includes advisory services that help clients assess their IT needs and formulate system implementation plans. Architecture planning includes advisory services that combine strategic plans and knowledge of emerging technologies to create the logical design of the system and the supporting infrastructure to meet customer requirements. Operational assessment/benchmarking include services that assess the operating efficiency and capacity of a client’s IT environment. Implementation planning includes services aimed at advising customers on the rollout and testing of new solution deployments.

ITFS (Instructional Television Fixed Service)

IT governance

IT governance is the set of processes that ensure the effective and efficient use of IT in enabling an organization to achieve its goals. IT governance addresses two major topics: IT demand governance (“doing the right things”) and IT supply-side governance (“doing things right”).

IT infrastructure

The system of hardware, software, facilities and service components that support the delivery of business systems and IT-enabled processes.

ITIL

The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is an IT service management framework, developed under the auspices of the U.K.’s Office of Government Commerce (OGC), that provides process guidance on the full life cycle of defining, developing, managing, delivering and improving IT services.

IT management

IT management services provide day-to-day management and operation of IT assets and processes. As such, they represent the core value components of ITO. IT management services are divided into three key subsegments: operations services (for IT infrastructure), application management services and help desk management services.

IT management services

Management services transfer all or part of the day-to-day management responsibility for a customer’s network environment (including LAN hardware and software, WAN – voice and data – and voice network hardware and software) and, in some cases, the ownership of the technology or personnel assets, to an outside vendor. These services may include system operation or support, capacity planning, asset management, availability management, performance management, administration, security, remote monitoring, technical diagnostics/troubleshooting, configuration management, system repair management and generation of management reports. Network remote monitoring and management, and backup and recovery services, also fall into this category when some degree of management is included in the service.

ITOM (IT operations management) software

IT operations management (ITOM) software is intended to represent all the tools needed to manage the provisioning, capacity, performance and availability of the computing, networking and application environment. The ITOM market is divided into 10 major segments that include DBMS, application management, availability and performance, event, fault and log management, network management, configuration management, IT services desk and IT help desk, asset management, job scheduling and other ITOM (which refers to output management software) for tools used to manage hardware peripherals, such as printers.

IT operations

The people and management processes associated with IT service management to deliver the right set of services at the right quality and at competitive costs for customers.

IT outsourcing (ITO)

IT outsourcing efforts focus on using external service providers to effectively deliver IT-enabled business process, application service and infrastructure solutions for business outcomes.

IT service desk (ITSD) and IT help desk

IT service desk (ITSD) products range from simple call tracking/trouble ticketing (aka “help desk” products) to broad suite solutions encompassing call management, incident management, problem management, IT change management, configuration/inventory repositories, request fulfillment and self-service portals. In their technical platform, ITSD products include knowledge management (knowledge search capability) and workflow engines (managing automated escalation and notification). The most-sophisticated products also may link to dominant brands of corporate portals, external workflow engines, procurement modules and HR systems, or include these as proprietary features. These products integrate with operations management systems for links to event alerts, additional inventory repositories, configuration information and remote control. Product suites must have native support for Web self-service, password automation and e-mail (“native” means that the vendor either has built its own component or has licensed an engine and built value around it). The products must integrate with a range of communications tools, from telephony components to Web chat.

Certain areas of ITSD product functionality address only portions of a given process. IT CM within the tool addresses only the governance (aka production change control) and not the change execution, such as application or software provisioning, patching, or automated configuration setting changes, managed by the CM category. Software code and version is a change execution activity delivered by programming teams during the development process using SCCM tools. However, releasing code into production comes under the CM category. IT change projects, such as coordinating people-intensive IT projects, are change planning activities delivered by PPM products. The self-service portal capability will provide knowledge search and the ability to request service and support; however, the execution of stand-alone automated restore, also called “self-healing” – in which the user or help desk personnel are not involved – is part of the CM category. Only products that are positioned as ITSDs are included in the ITSD category. Products positioned as portals, workflow platforms or integration brokers are tracked in the AIM category. The fraction of vendor revenue from customer support software, sold as “help desk,” is tracked as CRM software.

ITU (International Telecommunication Union)

Agency of the United Nations, headquartered in Geneva. The ITU is the body through which governments and the private sector coordinate global telecommunications networks and services.

IVR (interactive voice response)

A voice/call-processing option for improving call center functionality and integration. It enables callers to have more flexibility to access information or leave messages. Use of this option can “offload” call volume from agents to the IVR or improve load balancing by having agents handle recorded messages during slow periods. A slowly growing number of IVR developers are now using speech recognition in their applications.

Java

The term “Java” can be applied to Sun’s Java platform or to its Java programming language. The Java platform is made up of a set of technologies that provide cross-platform, network-centric computing solutions. The programming language is simply one aspect of the Java platform. The elements of the Java platform include the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which provides a uniform Java byte code emulator for Java’s cross-platform runtime environment; the Java programming language, which provides a robust, object-oriented language for constructing Java components and applications; and the standard Java-class library packages, which provide sets of reusable services that promote consistency among components and applications.

The Java programming language is based on C and extends and complements the basic capabilities of HTML. Java permits the creation of applications and application modules (called “applets”) that run in the JVM on the browser. Browsers from Netscape and Microsoft have a JVM. Java’s platform independence and security are designed in, rather than added on, so applications can run on a wide variety of desktop platforms as long as they can run a Java-enabled browser.

Java applet

A small piece of Java code that implements a specific function. Applets may run on a server or be downloaded and run on the client’s machine.

Java ME (Java Platform, Micro Edition)

Reduced-feature version of Java defined by Sun Microsystems for use in mobile devices, such as mobile phones. Java ME (formerly known as Java 2ME) is part of a set of related Java technologies that includes definitions of profiles and configurations.

Java platform AD tools

The Java platform AD tool market includes tools used to construct applications that operate within Java Community Process (JCP)-certified and JCP-compliant Java runtimes. These tools may include code-centric integrated development environments, or they may employ more-advanced features, such as model-driven code generators or other architected rapid AD features.

JavaScript

A scripting language targeted specifically to the Internet. It is the first scripting language to fully conform to ECMAScript, the Web’s only standard scripting language. Despite its name, JavaScript is not a derivative of Java; its origin is Netscape’s Livescript language. JavaScript is, in fact, closer to C/C++ in syntax than it is to Java.

Java servlet

A Java program that operates in conjunction with a Web server, and can output Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to a browser or even communicate with Java applets. Servlets offer an alternative to using Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and server application programming interfaces (SAPIs) to communicate with Web server processes.

jidoka

Automatic inspection such that defects can be prevented from moving further along in the production process.

JIT (just in time)

An approach of sequencing the arrival of material to a work center just prior to consumption to avoid large work-in-process inventories.

job scheduling

Job scheduling tools supervise a logical process (several jobs or programs) as they execute in a mainframe or distributed environment, providing scheduling and dependency management of the process as it runs, mainly in sequence, across disparate systems, geographies and applications. The tools in this category are used for “batch integration” of heterogeneous applications and data stores.

jukebox

An automatic media handler for an optical disk drive, also called a library. An optical jukebox is designed to move optical platters in and out of optical drives. The intent is to provide a large amount of easily accessed storage in a “near-line” fashion. Jukeboxes use robotics. Similar in concept to music jukeboxes, the robot arm locates the appropriate disk and, if it is not already mounted in a drive, clears the drive and loads the selected disk.

Junction Point

Microsoft term for a mount point, available in NT 5.0.

K

Ka-band (Kurtz-above band)

Frequency range allocated from 17.7GHz on the downlink and to 30.6GHz on the uplink for use by satellite communication systems. Ka-band satellites deliver high-speed broadband Internet connectivity and digital video/audio transmission. Satellites in this frequency range are characterized by two-way or bidirectional communications capability; wider-bandwidth transponders that provide higher overall capacity spot beams that can direct or focus signal transmissions to areas of higher density/population; and more-efficient use of available spectrum through multiple reuse of the same frequency. Ka-band satellites can be implemented as GEO- and non-GEO satellite systems. See also Kurtz-under band (Ku-band), L-band and S-band.

kaikaku

Radical and significant improvement.

kaizen

Incremental, continuous improvement.

kanban

A system that uses signals along a production process to implement the concept of JIT.

Kano Model

K-map (knowledge map)

A representation of concepts and their relationships (e.g., hierarchy, taxonomy and network). A K-map is a navigational aid that enables a user to hone in rapidly on the desired concept, and then follow links to relevant knowledge sources (information or people).

KM strategy

A declaration of how the enterprise will use knowledge to compete, and how knowledge management (KM) will support the enterprise’s business strategies. A KM strategy may be knowledge-focused if the enterprise’s market value is predominantly composed of intellectual capital, or knowledge-enabled if the enterprise has other valuable assets in addition to intellectual capital.

knowledge access

One of the five activities of the knowledge management (KM) process framework. Knowledge access is the retrieval or dissemination of knowledge to users.

knowledge architect

The individual who oversees implementation of the enterprise’s knowledge architecture, who leads the “knowledge architecture team” in identifying, organizing and providing access to scattered, heterogeneous information in digital and paper form, and who leads the knowledge audit to determine and continually re-evaluate the specific knowledge needs of users and their business processes. The knowledge architect defines knowledge processes and identifies the technology requirements for creating, capturing, organizing, accessing and using knowledge assets.

knowledge assets

Information relevant to an enterprise’s business function, including the captured and tacit knowledge of employees, customers or business partners; data and information stored in structured databases; data and information stored in textual form and unstructured databases (e.g., e-mail and workflow systems); information stored in digital and paper documents; purchased content; and public content from the Internet or other sources.

knowledge audit

A formal determination and evaluation of how and where knowledge is used in business processes. The knowledge audit identifies implicit user needs, as well as explicit information stores. With the audit, enterprises can identify and evaluate all information resources and workflows, and determine enterprise user access requirements. Access requirements will vary widely, from wide access (e.g., policies and procedures ) to extremely limited access (e.g., payroll processing). The knowledge audit is a rigorous process using questionnaires, interviews and resource descriptions.

knowledge base

The knowledge, which may include assertion, rules, objects and constraints, used by a knowledge-based or expert system. Its organization is based on knowledge representations. The developer or user of the system may be unaware of the underlying knowledge representations, seeing only the domain knowledge representations.

knowledge capital

Intangible assets of an enterprise that are required to achieve business goals, including employee’s knowledge; data and information about processes, products, customers and competitors; and intellectual property such as patents or regulatory licenses.

knowledge capture

One of the five activities of the knowledge management process framework. Knowledge capture makes tacit knowledge explicit, i.e., it turns knowledge that is resident in the mind of the individual into an explicit representation available to the enterprise.

knowledge community

A group of people within an enterprise who engage in knowledge-sharing activities in support of a common work interest (shared responsibility for a business process, a product or service, or a project). The KC may include people from multiple disciplines within the enterprise, as well as extended-enterprise participants (service providers, supply-chain partners or customers).

knowledge content owners

Individuals who oversee the definition and delivery of knowledge content for their business processes to the knowledge management environment, and define access privileges to their knowledge resources. Human-resources executives are an example of knowledge content owners for benefits information resources; as such, they are responsible for ensuring that appropriate benefits content is available to support knowledge user and resource requirements, and that appropriate users are granted or denied access to it.

knowledge content specialists

Individuals who refine knowledge content from the originating owner into the specific product that the knowledge users require. These specialists have strong skills in the business process and its knowledge resources, as well as skill in organizing and filtering knowledge into a highly accessible and usable form. An extension to this definition is the external knowledge content specialist, who manages access to external content that the enterprise has purchased or subscribed to.

knowledge organization

One of the five activities of the knowledge management process framework. Knowledge organization is the classification and categorization of knowledge for navigation, storage and retrieval. This includes knowledge maintenance.

knowledge representation

Structures used to store knowledge in a manner that relates items of knowledge to one another, and that permits an inference engine to manipulate the knowledge and its relationships.

knowledge sharing

An activity that spans three components of the knowledge management (KM) process – knowledge capture, knowledge organization and knowledge access – to enable people to share knowledge across the boundaries of geography and time.

knowledge use

One of the five activities of the knowledge management process framework. Knowledge use is the application of knowledge to business decisions or opportunities. Use is also recursive, and continually generates feedback that affects and is integrated into the other knowledge activities.

knowledge users

Participants in knowledge management programs. They fill the dual roles of applying knowledge in their work tasks and contributing their own knowledge and insight to the enterprise’s knowledge content.

knowledge work management

A discipline that promotes an integrated approach to identifying, managing and sharing all of an enterprise’s information assets. Knowledge work management focuses on extending knowledge management to business processes (i.e., policies and procedures as well as unwritten rules).

knowledge workplace

This represents the intersection of three key trends: the leverage of intellectual capital, the virtualization of the workplace and the shift from hierarchical to organic models of management. The focus is on knowledge as the primary source of competitive advantage.

kohai

Japanese for “protégé”; used in lean enterprises to describe a student of lean practices who learns from a senpai.

KPI (key performance indicator)

A high-level measure of system output, traffic or other usage, simplified for gathering and review on a weekly, monthly or quarterly basis. Typical examples are bandwidth availability, transactions per second and calls per user. KPIs are often combined with cost measures (e.g., cost per transaction or cost per user) to build key system operating metrics.

KPIV (key process input variable)

Key process input variable – the most important input(s) to a process.

KPOV (key process output variable)

Key process output variable – the most important output(s) of a process.

KTS

A customer-premises telephone switching system that allows telephones to interface with the public telephone central exchange or internal lines (extensions) via nominated key access or an access code. Most KTSs are now of a hybrid capability, with PBX and KTS functions merged into a user-designated mix.

Ku-band (Kurtz-under band)

Frequency range allocated from 10.9GHz to 17GHz. Ku-band satellites are among the most numerous, operating for all forms of satellite communications, including video, voice and data services for consumers and enterprises. Most VSATs are in the Ku-band and are predominantly GEO-based systems. Ku-band satellite antennas (which are smaller than C-band antennas but suffer from rain fade in monsoon-like downpours) are typically used in Europe and North America. Bidirectional/interactive Ku-band antenna sizes range from 75 centimeters to 1.8 meters. See also Ka-band, L-band and S-band.

L

lagging and leading key performance indicators

Lagging indicators are metrics that measure end-state objectives or desired outcomes. They include all financial metrics. Nonprofit and public sector enterprises have additional nonfinancial lagging indicators that measure desired outcomes, such as students who graduate, incidence of crime and lives lost to terrorism.

Leading indicators are a defined set of metrics that are predictive of financial or other desired outcomes.

LAN (local-area network)

A geographically limited communication network that connects users within a defined area. A LAN is generally contained within a building or small group of buildings and is managed and owned by a single enterprise. The shorter distances within a building or campus enable faster communications at a lower cost than wide-area networks (WANs). Although an increasing number of LANs use Internet standards and protocols, they are normally protected from the public Internet by firewalls.

LANs are generally used to perform the following functions:

• Send output to printers attached to the network.
• Transfer data or software to or from other systems attached to the network.
• Send e-mail to other users on the network.
• Access wider-area networks, including the Internet, via a direct connection from the network, for external file transfer, e-mail, facsimile, group collaboration and videoconferencing.

LAN bridging

The connection of multiple physical local-area networks (LANs) to support a single logical LAN environment.

language-oriented development environments (distributed platforms, proprietary)

Typically, these are development environments for code targeted to deploy to distributed platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix) built on a compiler and a language. Language-oriented development environments generally include graphical user interface (GUI) builders, debuggers, editors and other utilities that are integrated into the environment. This market also includes proprietary fourth-generation language (4GL) language tools. It excludes products specifically targeted at deploying to either Java or .NET. It includes revenue for products such as PowerBuilder and Visual Basic 6.0 to the extent they target proprietary runtimes. It also includes languages such as COBOL, C/C++, FORTRAN, Ada and PASCAL, among others, that target proprietary runtimes on distributed platforms.

language-oriented development environments (mainframe, mini and midrange)

Typically, these are development environments for code targeted for deployment on mainframe or midrange platforms built on a compiler and a language, such as COBOL, C/C++, FORTRAN, Ada and PASCAL, among others. Language-oriented development environments generally include GUI builders, debuggers, editors and other utilities that are integrated into the environment. This market also includes proprietary 4GL language tools. It excludes products specifically targeted at deploying to either Java or .NET.

laser

A device that emits a highly coherent beam of light. The term stands for “light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.” A typical laser has an active medium, which emits light, and a cavity structure, which selects certain wavelengths and directions for the emitted light. Lasers convert electrical energy into radiant energy in the visible or infrared parts of the spectrum, emitting light with a small spectral bandwidth. For this reason, they are widely used in fiber-optic communications, particularly as sources for long-haul links.

laser disk

An storage medium that uses laser technology to record and retrieve data.

latency

Measure of the responsiveness of a network, often expressed as the round-trip time (in milliseconds); that is, the time between initiating a network request and receiving a response. High latency tends to have more impact than bandwidth on the end-user experience in interactive applications, such as Web browsing. Low latency is required for many next-generation IP applications, such as VoIP, video telephony and PTT. See also round-trip time (RTT).

lead management

Lead management integrates business process and technology to close the loop between marketing and sales channels, and to drive higher-value opportunities through improved demand creation, execution and opportunity management.

Lead management processes take in unqualified, “raw” leads from a variety of lead-generation sources, including Web registration pages and campaigns; direct mail campaigns; e-mail marketing; multichannel campaigns; database marketing and third-party leased lists; social CRM and social networking sites; and trade shows. The output of lead management processes – qualified, scored, nurtured, augmented and prioritized selling opportunities – are handed off to direct sales and channel sales organizations.

A key requirement is integration with CRM, sales force automation (SFA), partner relationship management (PRM) or related sales management systems. This includes the ability to pass qualified, prioritized and augmented leads to the sales organization for closure. It also enables analytic and reporting capability to track the amount, timing and source of closed leads.

long-haul DWDM and metro WDM systems

The first WDM systems were made for long-haul transport applications. WDM systems made it possible to split each fiber into a number of “virtual fibers” – one for each wavelength in the system. Given the high cost of long-haul fiber links, it was easy for WDM technology to offer a compelling value proposition, even though it was relatively expensive. In addition, a single optical amplifier for all the channels in a WDM system represented a clear cost advantage compared with the individual amplifiers and regenerators used in single-channel systems.

As a result of the great speed at which WDM technology has matured, it is now the technology of choice for both long-haul and metropolitan applications. Commercial DWDM systems are available with more than 100 channels, and the maximum line rate has been increased: first from 2.5 Gbps to 10 Gbps, and more recently to 40 Gbps.

The following are WDM subsegments:

• Metro WDM: WDM systems without in-line amplifiers, including both DWDM and coarse WDM (CWDM).
• Long-haul DWDM: Systems with in-line amplifiers. In-line optical amplifiers are considered an integral part of long-haul DWDM systems.

There is an increasing demand in the long-haul DWDM segment for equipment supporting the ITU’s Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) G.709 standard (“Interface for the Optical Transport Network”). This standard aims at improving network operations in relation to DWDM equipment and OXE, while ensuring backward compatibility with SDH/SONET.

LTE (long term evolution)

A 3GPP project to define the requirements and basic framework for the WCDMA mobile radio access network beyond 3G, also known as Release 8 – probably the last step before 4G. The core specifications for Release 8 were completed in late 2007, with commercial deployments scheduled in 2010. LTE includes objectives such as: 100 Mbps download and 50 Mbps upload peak data rates in 20MHz of spectrum; full mobility to speeds of up to 500 km per hour; support for 3G network overlay and handovers between 3G and LTE. It will likely use MIMO, OFDMA and single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) in the link layers. Notably, it will not use CDMA for the radio layer, and there is a major operator-driven effort under way by ETSI to cap the IP royalties for LTE at a maximum of 5% of the cost of the equipment. 3GPP is working on an extended version of LTE called LTE advanced, which will make LTE fully ITU-4G-compliant. See also MIMO, OFDMA, System Architecture Evolution (SAE) and UTRAN.

LTE-A

Long Term Evolution Advanced, is defined in 3GPP Release 10 and is intended to be the first fully compliant version of the ITU’s specification for 4G systems. The targeted peak rate for downlink is 1 Gbps and, for uplink, greater than 500 Mbps. This should be achieved with scalable usage of up to 100 MHz spectrum. LTE-A should support various cell types, including pico and femto, to improve uplink speeds as well as relay technologies to improve coverage. Furthermore, LTE-A should be backward compatible to LTE, Release 8.

An MES enables users to quickly locate and display information, thus shortening sales cycles and decreasing printing and distribution costs. An MES contains a database capable of storing all types of information that will be incorporated into the system (e.g., audio, video, sound, text and graphics). The system should have the capability to be used unconnected to a server and should include a remote communications mechanism for electronically downloading and uploading information.

mesh network

Has no centralized access points but uses wireless nodes to create a virtual wireless backbone. Mesh network nodes typically establish network links with neighboring nodes, enabling user traffic to be sent through the network by hopping between nodes on many different paths. At least some nodes must be connected to a core network for backhaul. Mesh networks are self-healing, self-organizing and somewhat scalable, with additional capacity supplied by adding incremental nodes. See also Wi-Fi mesh.

message authentication

A function in which the device determines if the received message arrived from its stated source and in unaltered form. The actual message need not be encrypted, but its authentication code must be.

message broker

A logical hub that copies and resends messages to one or more destinations. As a value-adding third party between information sources and information consumers, it can complement a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Like an SOA, a broker is a design abstraction that may be implemented using component software for some or all of the connections. The interface from a message broker to the application may use an object request broker (ORB) or object transaction monitor (OTM); a request to the message broker may be implemented as a series of method calls to participating components.

message feedback

A method of checking the accuracy of data transmission. The received data is returned to the sending end for comparison with the original data, which is stored there for this purpose. Also called information feedback and loop checking.

message format

Rules for the placement of portions of a message, such as the heading, address, text, end-of-message indication and error-detecting bits.

message numbering

The identification of each message within a communications system through the assignment of a sequential number.

message passing

Services performing a simple, one-way transfer operation between two programs. Like the other one-way messaging models, message passing generally leaves the sending program unblocked. Also, as with all forms of messaging, message passing is usually connectionless, which means that the sending application does not have to explicitly establish and manage a connection with the message’s intended recipient. Although message passing is not inherently a two-way communication model, two-way communication can be accomplished by sending the response in a separate message.

message queuing

The message-queuing or store-and-forward model is basically the message-passing model with one additional feature. Message queuing is asynchronous in a manner similar to a traditional postal system – i.e., the recipient need not be available when the message is sent. Message queuing stores messages at an intermediate node on the network in a queue and then forwards the messages to the intended targets.

message switching

The technique of receiving a message, storing it until the proper outgoing line is available, and then retransmitting it. Unlike in-line switching, no direct connection between the incoming and outgoing lines is established.

message warehouse

A message broker service that temporarily stores messages to be analyzed or retransmitted at a later time.

messaging

Alphanumeric or graphic one-way or two-way service that sends, receives and displays messages on a mobile device.

messaging device

A data-centric device designed primarily to process electronic messages. A basic messaging device weighs less than 1 pound and is designed for one-way outbound messaging. Limited responses, such acknowledgments, are also possible but are not common. A two-way messaging device weighs less than 1 pound and is designed to send and receive messages.

metadata

Metadata is analagous to the table of contents in a book, with the actual chapters being your data. Metadata on a storage unit, such as a hard drive, is used by the filesystem only, as a frame to access user data. Metadata constitutes the structure of the filesystem. Metadata examples from various filesystems include FATs, inode tables, free block lists, free block bitmaps, logging areas, and the superblock. In order to preserve file names and to recover fragmented files (imagine a chapter in a book being divided up among other chapters in the book) it is highly crucial to recover the metadata. Further, meta-data is definitional data

that provides information about or documentation of other data managed within an application or environment. For example, meta data would document data about data elements or attributes, (name, size, data type, etc) and data about records or data structures (length, fields, columns, etc) and data about data (where it is located, how it is associated, ownership, etc.). Meta data may include descriptive information about the context, quality and condition, or characteristics of the data. Metadata is information that describes various facets of an information asset to improve its usability throughout its life cycle. It is metadata that makes information into an asset. Generally speaking, the more valuable the information asset, the more critical it is to manage the metadata about it, because it is the metadata definition that provides understanding that unlocks the value of data.

metadata and data modeling tools

Metadata and data modeling tools support the creation and documentation of models describing the structures, flows, mappings and transformations, relationships, and quality of data. These tools enable users to discover and design data models, create relationships between models, and map and reconcile physical models to logical models.

Recent market activity has created a demand for open access to a wide array of metadata that was previously not considered under the metadata management definition. As a result, metadata management is now pursued through the creation of metadata repositories and the introduction of at least a browsing interface for developers and end users alike.

Metadata can also be used in an active or passive role in the organization, and the tools represent this dichotomy as well. Many metadata tools collect and collate metadata in a passive documentation and viewing role that provides for data definition review, business process flow evaluation, data lineage analysis, change impact analysis and many other passive activities. These tools are considered more-traditional tools. A few metadata tools address the concept of active metadata. Active metadata solutions collect information on current system operations, notify end users of data content changes and perform routing tasks for information to end users.

metadirectory

method-of-purchase segmentation

The IT services market can be divided by the primary methods of purchase used by end users and IT services providers:

• Discrete – Project-specific contractual arrangement, with a predetermined scope of work to be completed within a given time period. With discrete services, management responsibility for the delivery of services and outcome is retained by the company; discrete projects may last a few weeks to several years, depending on the project. Typical projects can include, but are not limited to, custom AD, legacy transition services, and enterprise application integration and deployment. In discrete services, management responsibility for the delivery of services and outcome is retained by the company. Typical projects can include, but are not limited to, general staff augmentation, custom application development, legacy transition services, and enterprise application integration.
• Outsourcing – Multiyear or annuity-based contractual arrangement, whereby a company provisions services on an ongoing basis at a specified level of competency. Outsourcing involves some degree of transfer of management responsibility for the ongoing delivery of IT services or processes to an external provider, with performance tied to service levels or outcomes. Outsourcing encompasses the management of IT infrastructure (data center, desktop or network), enterprise applications and business processes. Outsourcing agreements always include services from the management category, transaction processing or business management segments, and may include services from the product support, consulting, and development and integration. As part of an outsourcing agreement, the ESP may acquire the physical assets or the employees of a business client. Services may be provided at the client site or remotely from a vendor-owned site.

MMS (multimedia messaging service)

3GPP mobile messaging standard that supports picture messaging, sound, graphics and voice. Unlike EMS, MMS does not draw on established messaging technology (such as SMS). Instead, it requires network operators to deploy new infrastructure, including a multimedia messaging service center. It uses a wireless data bearer to deliver messages and requires MMS functionality in mobile devices. The MMS standard was defined jointly by the 3GPP (TS 23.140) and the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), incorporating the WAP Forum. MMS supports many features that could not be delivered using established mobile messaging standards.

Wireless access solutions deployed using standardized cellular or low-mobility infrastructure and mobile devices. This primarily includes technologies such as cdmaOne (IS-95A and B), cdma2000 1x RTT, Personal HandyPhone System (PHS) and personal access communication services (PACS). For commercial or regulatory reasons, mobile WLLs are not operated as full mobility cellular services, even though the networks may be technically capable of supporting such services. Personal Access System (PAS) is a trademark of UTStarcom for its portfolio of mobile WLL products based on the PHS standard.

Mobisode

Audio (or audio and video) content specifically designed for playback on mobile audio/video players such as Apple’s iPod and MPEG-enabled mobile phones. Mobisodes are an example of “sticky” content and are similar in concept to the radio programs of the 1940s and 1950s. These consisted of compelling short daily or weekly episodes that encouraged subscribers to keep coming back for the next edition. See also podcast.

• FM (frequency modulation)
• PAM (pulse amplitude modulation)
• PCM (pulse code modulation)
• PWM (pulse width modulation; also called PDM, or pulse duration modulation)

MOM (message-oriented middleware)

MOM products provide connectionless program-to-program communications services for intra-application and interapplication (that is, integration) purposes. Interactions implemented with MOM may be fully asynchronous (one way, store and forward) or partially synchronous (immediate, one-way delivery or two-way request/reply exchanges). MOM strengths are in connectionless (loosely coupled) communications, store and forward (queuing), guaranteed delivery, broad platform support (run on many OSs), and in some cases, content- or subject-based addressing (for example, publish and subscribe). Unlike remote procedure calls (RPCs), MOM products also support one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many delivery.

MOM products complement application servers by providing features that are missing or not well-supported through RPC and other connection-oriented communications mechanisms, such as Component Object Model (COM)+, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and SOAP RPC. All major Java application servers and most integration suites now include a bundled MOM service, often based on the Java Messaging System standard, but stand-alone (unembedded) MOM products are also still sold. The popular stand-alone (unembedded) communications middleware products on the market today are MOM or a combination of messaging and other forms of middleware.

MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group)

A digital video standard for compression of full-motion images. The compression ratios achieved with MPEG encoding make it an ideal standard for delivery of digital video data.

MPEG-1 deals with mono and stereo sound coding, at sampling frequencies commonly used for high-quality audio. MPEG-2 contains an extension to lower sampling frequencies, providing better sound quality at the low bit rates, and an extension for multichannel sound. MPEG-3 and MPEG-4, with further improvements, are under development. Both MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 have a three-layer structure. Each layer represents a family of coding algorithms. Layer 3 deals with sound encoding, and can’t be used by itself to encode audio files. In this form, it is known as MP3.

MRP II (manufacturing resource planning)

A method for effective planning of all the resources of a manufacturing company. Ideally, it addresses operational planning in units and financial planning in dollars, and has a simulation capability to answer “what if” questions. It is made up of a variety of functions, each linked together: business planning, production planning, master production scheduling (MPS), material requirements planning (MRP), capacity requirements planning (CRP) and the execution systems for capacity and priority. Outputs from these systems can be integrated with business reports (e.g., business plans, purchase commitment reports, shipping budgets or inventory projections). MRP II is a direct outgrowth and extension of MRP. MRP II is migrating toward enterprise resource planning (ERP).

Also known as “managed-service providers,” MSPs deliver network, application, system and e-management services across a network to multiple enterprises, using a “pay as you go” pricing model. A “pure play” MSP focuses on management services as its core offering. In addition, the MSP market includes offerings from other providers – including application service providers (ASPs), Web hosting companies and network service providers (NSPs) – that supplement their traditional offerings with management services. (See ASP and NSP.)

MSS (mobile satellite service)

Networks of communication satellites intended for use with mobile and portable wireless telephones. There are three major types: aeronautical MSS, land MSS and maritime MSS. See also ATC.

MSSP (managed security service provider)

MSSPs use high-availability security operation centers (either from their own facilities or from other data center providers) to provide 24×7 services designed to reduce the number of operational security personnel an enterprise needs to hire, train and retain to maintain an acceptable security posture.

MST (See Multi-Sector Transfer)

MSU (million service units)

Millions of service units (MSUs) were introduced to the IBM software pricing methodologies in the mid-1990s. For almost 10 years, there was a consistent ratio between MSUs and MIPS. In 2003, IBM changed its direction to publish separate “pricing” and “performance” MSUs. In 2004, IBM changed again, this time to assign a single published MSU rating for each system and capacity setting that standardized on what was previously called the “pricing” MSU. Today, MSUs are used for software pricing only; they are not a capacity metric. The ratio of MIPS to MSU varies depending upon IBM mainframe generation.

MTA (metropolitan trading area)

multicast

Multicast, as opposed to broadcast, is a signal transmitted to only a subset of potential destinations.

multichannel IPTV

The typical IPTV model involves both broadcast pay-TV and on-demand services. Most IPTV providers offer both, though it is multichannel pay TV that remains the key selling point in most services – and it generates most of the revenue. As a result, many IPTV services still have a strong focus on competing in a like-for-like manner against existing pay-TV services such as cable TV and direct-to-home (DTH) satellite offerings, often with similar packages of channels. Although this will change as new functionality is made available to IPTV users, it means that multichannel TV will be the foundation of IPTV offerings for several years. As a result, our key metric when sizing the market is the number of multichannel IPTV subscribers.

multienterprise (B2B) solutions

Multienterprise (B2B) gateway software is a form of integration middleware that is used to consolidate and centralize a company’s multienterprise data, application and process integration and interoperability requirements with external business partners. The types of projects supported by B2B gateway software include traditional approaches to B2B (including EDI), contemporary approaches to B2B (including XML and Applicability Statement 2 [AS2]), and emerging approaches to B2B (including service-oriented architecture [SOA] and Web-services-based process integration). It includes middleware technology from multiple disciplines, including integration middleware, ESBs, application servers, composite application suites, EDI translators, and B2B-enabled integration middleware that is increasingly available with packaged applications. The key point is that IT users are specifically looking for technology that enables them to manage all aspects of IT infrastructure.

multipoint line

A single communications channel (typically a leased telephone circuit) to which more than one station or logical unit is attached, though only one can transmit at a time. Such arrangements usually require a polling mechanism under the control of a master station to ensure that only one device transmits data at a time. Also called a multidrop line.

multiprogramming

A computer system operation whereby a number of independent jobs are processed together. Rather than allow each job to run to completion in turn, the computer switches between them so as to improve the use of the system hardware components.

Multi-Sector Transfer

multiple sectors, fixup, safety checks

multiservice edge routers

These routers are another subcategory of edge router. They are optimized to support the aggregation and convergence of traffic from disparate traditional networks and to forward it to the IP/MPLS network core. Multiservice edge routers have evolved to incorporate multiple services and to handle packet processing of ATM/frame relay, Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPNs, leased lines, video applications, broadband aggregation, Ethernet and voice applications. These routers support virtual private LAN service (VPLS) and all major routing protocols, and have a virtual IP/MPLS control plane.

Multiservice edge router vendors and their products include:

• Alcatel-Lucent: 7750 Service Router.
• Cisco: Cisco 7600 with OSM interface and Cisco ASR 9000.
• Juniper Networks: M320.
• Redback Networks: SmartEdge router series.
• Tellabs: 8800 MSR Series.

MVNO (mobile virtual network operator)

Company that does not own a mobile spectrum license but sells mobile services under its brand name using the network of a licensed mobile operator. Virgin Mobile is one example of an MVNO. The term is applied to a variety of arrangements with a mobile network operator. At one end are companies offering mobile services under a particular brand, with their own marketing and tariff structure, usually through a sophisticated CRM system. At the other end are companies with their own core network infrastructures, issuing their own SIM cards and controlling elements of network infrastructure such as the HLR and MSC, in addition to their own products.

NAS (network-attached storage)

A category of storage products in which the requisite hardware and software comes bundled into an integrated product, which is optimized for use as a dedicated file or storage management server attached to the enterprise’s network. Ideally, NAS is platform- and OS-independent, appears to any application as another server, can be brought online without shutting down the network and requires no changes to other enterprise servers.

NAT (network address translation)

NC (network computer)

Often called a “thin client,” a network computer is a limited-function desktop computer that is designed to easily connect to networks. NCs include a keyboard, mouse, monitor, memory and a network connection but only limited, if any, local disk storage. When end users want to access software or databases using an NC, they would use a graphical user interface (GUI), much as they do now with a PC. However, the software would be downloaded from a central server instead of being resident on the desktop PC; large databases would also be maintained on the central server. All software backups, upgrades and maintenance would therefore be performed centrally on the network server.

NCCJ (native code compiler for Java)

Translates byte code into a file format and binary-code representation that can be linked (using a static linker) with pre-compiled libraries and resources to form the executable program. An NCCJ provides the opportunity to optimize the structure of the program code to eliminate redundant code as well as to fine tune code sequences (e.g., loops, jumps and substitutions).

NCOP (network code of practice)

A code of standard practices for network design, intended to maintain technical standards.

NDC (networked data center)

A service that goes beyond making data center functionality available on a network. An NCC employs networking technology to treat multiple data centers and the network as a single system to efficiently access and process applications.

NDF (network dynamic functionality)

A software development and execution technology that allows applications to be written to a model designed from the outset to achieve platform independence. It affords dynamic movement and invocation of code resources over a network at runtime.

necessary non-value-adding

Non-value-adding activities that are necessary under the present operating system or equipment. They are likely to be difficult to remove in the short term but may be possible to eliminate in the medium term by changing equipment or processes. Often used to describe regulatory compliance activity that adds no direct customer value but is required to maintain the “license to operate.”

nemawashi

“Lining up the ducks” or “going among the roots” (literally) – the activity of laying a foundation for further activity.

.NET

At its core, .NET represents Microsoft’s implementation of the Web services concept, which treats software as a set of services accessible over ubiquitous networks using Web-based standards and protocols, although Microsoft has broadly applied the .NET moniker to several independent technologies and initiatives that have little to do with Web services (for example, .NET Enterprise Servers).

As a software infrastructure, .NET consists of two programming models:

• A Web services programming model, which exposes programming interfaces through Internet standards. This loosely coupled model uses HTTP and other Internet protocols as the main underlying transport mechanisms, and also uses XML, SOAP, WSDL and Universal Description, Discovery and Integration. Initially, most of this model will use a request/reply communications style.
• A system programming model designed to supersede Microsoft’s COM and the Windows application programming interfaces over time. This model introduces a new set of fundamental classes and a new runtime environment – the Common Language Runtime – providing an object-oriented class hierarchy structure as part of the application runtime environment. It also provides classes and mechanisms that enable programs to be “wrapped” as Web services, so it can ease – but is not required for – Web services development.

net new connections

Gross new connections minus the number of disconnections from the network in a given period.

network

Any number of computers (e.g., PCs and servers) and devices (e.g., printers and modems) joined together by a physical communications link. In the enterprise context, networks allow information to be passed between computers, irrespective of where those computers are located. Networks provide the roads for information traffic (e.g., sending files and e-mail) within a corporate environment, and allow users to access databases and share applications residing on servers. If a network does not go outside of a company building, or campus, then it is known as a local-area network (LAN). If it has a bridge to other outside networks, usually via lines owned by public telecommunications carriers like AT&T, then it is known as a wide-area network (WAN).

network appliance

A type of computing appliance that aids in the flow of information to other network-connected computing devices. Services that may be provided by a network appliance include firewall functions, caching, authentication, network address translation and IP address management.

network computing

A client/server application architecture with dynamic application deployment, execution and management. Network computing is characterized by four properties: dynamic cached propagation; write once, run anywhere; automatic platform adjustment; and network context storage.

network database

A database organized according to ownership of records, allowing records to have multiple owners and thus providing multiple access paths to the data. Database management systems (DBMSs) providing such capabilities are also known as CODASYL (Conference on Data Systems Languages) DBMSs.

network management

These are applications designed to isolate and resolve faults on the network, measure and optimize performance, manage the network topology, track resource use over time, initially provision and reconfigure elements, and account for network elements. Suites that include fault monitoring and diagnosis, provisioning/configuration, accounting, performance management, and TCP/IP application management – but only for networks – are also included here. This network management segment is intended for products that are mainly or entirely network-oriented and used primarily by enterprises.

Also included in this category are network CM tools. These tools set, change, collect and restore information about network devices (such as bridges, routers, switches and so forth).

network outsourcing (enterprise and public network)

Network outsourcing is a multiyear or annuity contract/relationship involving the purchase of ongoing network or telecom management services for managing, enhancing, maintaining and supporting premises or core network infrastructure or enterprise telecommunications assets (including fixed and wireless). In addition to network or telecommunications management, network outsourcing isolates those services specifically delivered in a longer-term contract in support of network infrastructures: consulting/advisory services, network AD and integration, network infrastructure deployment and support services.

Network outsourcing is segmented into two categories: enterprise network outsourcing and public network outsourcing. Enterprise network outsourcing does not include discrete, project-based professional services or staff augmentation services. Also, enterprise network outsourcing does not include services related to the physical cable plant or other facilities-related services (such as power conditioning). For public network outsourcing, we include services related to the carrier network, business and operations support systems. Internal ITO is not considered, nor are services related to public network facilities and logistics planning (for example, DC power, land acquisition and tower placement). Similarly, discrete, project-based professional services or staff augmentation services (commonly referred to as engineer-furnish-install) are not included in public network outsourcing.

network performance tuning/configuring facilities

The ability to configure combinations of local-area networks (LANs) and wide-area networks (WANs) centrally and dynamically based on anticipation and prioritization of data traffic volumes. Physical data paths could be configured based on data traffic content (i.e., transaction type). This is particularly important for online transaction processing (OLTP) applications.

network redundancy

A communications pathway that has additional links to connect all nodes in case one link goes down.

network security

Measures taken to protect a communications pathway from unauthorized access to, and accidental or willful interference of, regular operations.

network topology

Describes the physical and logical relationship of nodes in a network, the schematic arrangement of the links and nodes, or some hybrid combination thereof.

network virtual terminal

A communications concept describing a variety of data terminal equipment (DTE), with different data rates, protocols, codes and formats, accommodated in the same network. This is done as a result of network processing where each device’s data is converted into a network standard format, then converted into the format of the receiving device at the destination end.

neural net or neural network

An artificial-intelligence processing method within a computer that allows self-learning from experience. Neural nets can develop conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.

NEXT (near-end crosstalk)

Unwanted energy transferred from one circuit, usually to an adjoining circuit. It occurs at the end of the transmission link where the signal source is located, with the absorbed energy usually propagated in the opposite direction of the absorbing channel’s normal current flow. It is usually caused by high-frequency or unbalanced signals and insufficient shielding.

NFC (near field communication)

Emerging short-range networking technique designed to provide a means of conducting secure transactions for consumer applications. NFC enables a combination of RFID and connectivity-enabling devices to read tags and conduct transactions, and operates over a range of 10 centimeters, or about 4 inches. The physical, data link and networking layer specifications were released in October 2003 as ISO 18092. The Near Field Communication Forum industry body is developing higher-level protocols focusing on incorporating NFC for making transactions on mobile phones, PCs and consumer electronics. NFC is unique among short-range wireless technologies in that it uses magnetic induction rather than electromagnetic waves. It will be capable of working in conjunction with other wireless technologies to simplify and effectively establish secure connections between devices enabled by Bluetooth, UWB and ZigBee to exchange pairing information. See also FeliCa.

NG (next-generation)

NGN (next-generation network)

Generic term that describes the evolution and migration of fixed and mobile network infrastructures from distinct, proprietary networks to converged networks based on IP.

Nibble

Half of a byte (4 bits).

NIC (network interface card)

The bus-specific adapter that connects an end station or server to a local-area network (LAN). It plugs into an expansion slot on a workstation or server that is to be networked and has a connector for the network cabling.

NLO (net-liberated organization)

A concept describing an organizational philosophy enabled by the advent of the Internet and related Web technologies. Rather than “bolting on” Web initiatives to mainstream operations (i.e., integrating the Internet into business processes, but leaving the structure of these processes intact) an NLO uses these technologies to liberate itself from the constraints of traditional business environments that focus on local and physical infrastructures.

The goal of an NLO is to transform the enterprise into one that is more agile, and thus better able to meet customer demands. As such, the Internet is the primary enabler of liberating organizations from constraints associated with:

• Time (when business is conducted)
• Place (where business is conducted)
• Hierarchy (how people interrelate)
• Ownership (who owns the assets deployed for business)
• Information (how information is disseminated and used in human and process activities)

NLP (natural-language processing)

The process of converting narrative text to coded facts. Typically, a body of information – such as a series of publications, reports or even a collection of messages – is analyzed and the results displayed as dominant associations or relationships, and show which topics or subjects occurred most frequently.

NLU (natural-language understanding)

The comprehension by computers of the structure and meaning of human language (e.g., English, Spanish, Japanese), allowing users to interact with the computer using natural sentences.

NMC (network management center)

The center used for control of a network. It may provide traffic analysis, call detail recording, configuration control, fault detection and diagnosis and maintenance.

NMOS (N-channel metal-oxide semiconductor)

A microelectronic circuit used for logic and memory chips and in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) design. NMOS transistors are faster than the P-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (PMOS) counterpart, and more of them can be put on a single chip.

NMT-450 (Nordic Mobile Telephone)

A cellular standard that operates in the 450MHz band. It is the original specification for analog cellular telephony developed for the four Nordic countries and was subsequently deployed in some Eastern European, South American and Asia/Pacific countries.

NMT-900

NMT standard operating at 900MHz.

NMT-F

French variation of the NMT-900 standard.

Node B

WCDMA/UMTS term for a radio base station receiver, as defined by the 3GPP. It provides radio coverage and converts data between the radio network and the RNCs.

nomadic wireless

Term used by the WiMAX Forum for semimobile wireless. The terms “nomadic,” “portable” and “mobile” often vary in definition when used by vendors. See also fixed wireless and mobile wireless.

non-value-adding

Those activities within a company or supply chain that do not directly contribute to satisfying end consumers’ requirements. It is useful to think of these as activities that consumers would not be happy to pay for.

nonwireline cellular carrier

A U.S. term referring to Block A carriers. Nonwireline or Block A systems operate on radio frequencies from 824 to 848 megahertz (MHz).

NOS (network operating system)

A set of software utilities that, working in conjunction with an operating system, provides the local-area network (LAN) user interface and controls network operation. A network operating system communicates with the LAN hardware and enables users to communicate with one another and to share files and peripherals. Typically, a NOS provides file-to-print services, directory services and security.

notebook

A computer system designed for portability. It comes with a battery and typically measures 8.5 inches by 11 inches and weighs less than 8 pounds with the battery and weight-saver modules. Notebooks use flat-panel color screens of Super Video Graphics Array (SVGA) resolution or higher. They offer expansion through PC-Card technologies and have specialized integrated pointing devices. Types of notebooks include:

• Desktop Alternative: This is a computer system that meets all the criteria for a notebook PC but is designed to replicate the functionality of a desktop. It weighs 6 pounds or above. The screen can be as large as 15 inches or 16 inches with SVGA resolution or higher. Target markets include engineers and end users wanting to travel carrying minimal weight.
• Mainstream: This is a computer system that meets all the criteria for a notebook PC but is designed to be the best compromise between all-inclusive functionality and light weight. Mainstream notebooks weigh between 4.5 and 6 pounds with the weight-saver and battery modules. Mainstream notebooks often have a single bay for the inclusion of a peripheral, such as a CD-ROM.
• Ultraportable: This is a computer system that meets all the criteria for a notebook PC but is lighter and may not have an internal floppy disk drive. It typically weighs 4 pounds or less with the battery and weight-saver modules. The keyboard and screen are often compromised to meet weight targets and the unit must be augmented with a standard keyboard and mouse for long-term use.

notification services

Notification services are applications used to notify teams such as medical staff, technical assistants and financial brokers – as well as customers or other regular recipients – of events, alerts or calls. Notification can be sent via a user’s preferred channel of communication, such as voice mail, e-mail, SMS, IM or phone. Notification services can also be used by team co-workers to escalate unresolved issues to management.

NPV (net present value)

An accounting tool that captures the net value of an investment at the current instant in time by taking the sum of the discounted cash flow less the current investment.

NSM (network and systems management)

The intersection of networking, network management and systems management. The vision of NSM (also known as “networked systems management”)is to enable the management of a distributed set of systems in a fashion similar to that in which many centralized data centers are managed.

NSP (network service provider)

Any provider of network services, interexchange carriers (IXCs) and Internet service providers (ISPs).

This is one of the named indexes belonging to $Quota and $ObjId.

See also: Index, $Q, $ObjId and $Quota.

OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards)

An international nonprofit consortium that promotes open, collaborative development of e-business specifications based on public standards such as XML and SGML.

object-based middleware

Runtime software that enables objects (components) to work cooperatively with a container program or another object, even if the software is distributed across multiple computers.

object-based technologies

Technologies in which objects have encapsulation.

object class

A grouping of objects that can be described in terms of the attributes its members have in common. Generic e-mail, for example, could be an object class, because all e-mail systems have certain things in common.

object data model

A data model based on object-oriented programming, associating methods (procedures) with objects that can benefit from class hierarchies. Thus, “objects” are levels of abstraction that include attributes and behavior. An object-oriented data model is one that extends the individual program space into the world of persistent object management and shareability.

object encapsulation

Hiding complexity. Data and procedures may be encapsulated to produce a single object.

$OBJECT_ID

This attribute stores a mapping between a SID and a Security Hash.

object inheritance

Inheritance defines a relationship among classes in which a subclass shares, overrides or supplements operations or data values from one or more superclasses. A subclass is a specialization of one or more superclasses.

object instance

A specific occurrence of an object. For example, a specific mail message document is an instance.

object late binding

Runtime interpretation of messages. Using late binding, objects are integrated at runtime, as opposed to compiling an integrated object. This greatly enhances flexibility.

object management

Middleware that manages the naming, location and invocation of objects in a system.

object message passing

In object-oriented systems, one object never operates on another. Instead, one object may pass a message to another object requesting invocation of a method – e.g., “print yourself,” “display yourself” or “file yourself.”

object method

Methods define what can be done with an object. Methods for an electronic-mail document may be display, send, file or print.

object-oriented system

In an object-oriented system, all data is represented as discrete objects with which the user and other objects may interact. Each object contains data as well as information about the executable file needed to interpret that data. An object-oriented system allows the user to focus completely on tasks rather than tools. Examples of object-oriented programming languages include C++ and Smalltalk.

$ObjId

This attribute record’s the unique identifiers given to files and directorys when using Distributed Link Tracking.

OBSAI (Open Base Station Architecture Initiative)

Industry initiative to produce a number of common, open interfaces within the base station. OBSAI is working to define three internal base station interfaces across GSM/EDGE, cdma2000 and WCDMA. Unlike CPRI, OBSAI is open for membership to all industry players, but the interfaces are not available to non-OBSAI members.

ODM (own design manufacturer)

A company that designs, develops and manufactures mobile devices under contract. These devices are sold to end users under the brand of the mobile-device vendor, wireless service provider or contract partner. Examples of ODMs include Taiwan-based BenQ, GVC and HTC.

ODP (on-device portal)

Small downloadable mobile applications provided by media companies, handset vendors and some operators that make it easier for users to obtain new services such as music, videos, games and applications “off-deck” – that is, from independent websites. The traditional operator approach to media distribution has been to allow access only to an operator-controlled “walled garden” of content. This has not been popular with consumers, and many operators now allow open access to the Internet, seeking revenue growth from increased data traffic. Examples of ODPs include the Apple iPhone’s top-level menu and mobile clients such as Flickr and Facebook. See also off-deck portal.

ODS (operational data store)

A new articulation of the perennial concept of shared production data. Different from a data warehouse, the ODS is an alternative to having operational decision support system (DSS) applications access data directly from the database that supports transaction processing (TP).

While both require a significant amount of planning, the ODS tends to focus on the operational requirements of a particular business process (for example, customer service), and on the need to allow updates and propagate those updates back to the source operational system from which the data elements were obtained. The data warehouse, on the other hand, provides an architecture for decision makers to access data to perform strategic analysis, which often involves historical and cross-functional data and the need to support many applications.

OEM (original equipment manufacturer)

The term “OEM” is used to describe a technology provider that distributes output devices produced by another company under its own brand name. For example, Kyocera Mita is a manufacturer but also supplies products to be sold under the Olympia, Triumph-Adler and Utax OEM brands.

Ofcom (Office of Communications)

Regulator and competition authority for communications in the U.K., with responsibilities across TV, radio, telecommunications and wireless-communication services. See also Office of Communications.

OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing)

Spread spectrum modulation technology that uses different carrier frequencies spread across a frequency band to carry data traffic. OFDM is spectrally more efficient than traditional wide-area wireless technologies. Variations on OFDM are included in 802.20 and 802.16 technologies, as well as being under consideration for use in other future wireless technologies, including LTE and 4G. See also Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA).

OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access)

Based on OFDM, multiple access is achieved by assigning subsets of subcarriers to individual users. Adaptive subcarrier assignment (including different numbers of subcarriers to different users) means that OFDMA can support QoS and is potentially more spectrally efficient and less susceptible to fading and interference than OFDM. OFDMA is a required technology for mobile WiMAX and LTE. See also LTE, OFDM and WiMAX.

off-deck portal

Service or website not controlled by the network service provider (NSP) where consumers can access, rent or buy media content – typically using an on-device portal. NSPs traditionally have tried to maintain a “walled garden” approach to content, but this has not been popular with consumers. Many operators now allow open access to the Internet, seeking revenue growth from increased data traffic. Examples of off-deck portals include Apple’s iTunes and YouTube. See also on-device portal.

offshore programming

The contracting by a company for software services to be carried out in a country other than its own – e.g., a user located in North America may choose to have applications maintenance work carried out in India.

off-the-shelf

Equipment already manufactured and available for delivery from stock.

OFTA (Office of the Telecommunications Authority)

Regulator and competition authority for the telecommunications industry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. See also Office of the Telecommunications Authority.

OHA (Open Handset Alliance)

Established by Google in November 2007 and includes handset and electronics manufacturers such as HTC, Intel, LG, Motorola, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics and T-Mobile. OHA was formed to develop open standards for mobile devices and has released an open-source, mobile-phone platform called Android based on the Linux OS. See also Android.

OIS (office information system)

The architectural reference frame for the construction of an office solution that meets the needs that originate at all levels (individual, departmental and corporate), integrating them in a functional sense.

OLAP (online analytical processing)

A definition of multidimensional business intelligence (BI) servers, OLAP originated with a Code and Date white paper that defined 12 “OLAP product evaluation rules” as the basis for selecting multidimensional products. OLAP is, in truth, only a new name for a class of BI products, some of which have existed for decades. The 12 evaluation rules for providing OLAP to user-analysts are:

Multidimensional conceptual view
Transparency
Accessibility
Consistent reporting performance
Client/server architecture
Generic dimensionality
Dynamic sparse matrix handling
Multiuser support
Unrestricted cross-dimensional operations
Intuitive data manipulation
Flexible reporting
Unlimited dimensions and levels

OLCP (online complex processing)

An extension of online transaction processing (OLTP) to include concurrent ad hoc query and batch processing.

OLE (Object Linking and Embedding)

A Microsoft protocol that enables creation of compound documents with embedded links to applications, so that a user does not have to switch from one application to another to make revisions. With OLE:

• Users can create compound documents using multiple applications.
• Compound documents may contain text and spreadsheet objects, graphic and chart objects, sound objects, and video and animated objects.
• Objects that support OLE automation may be scripted by OLE controllers, such as Visual Basic, and used in end-user-developed applications.

OLED (organic light-emitting diode)

Display consisting of pixels of electroluminescent organic compounds “printed” in a matrix onto a flexible polymer layer, and which emits light of different colors. Unlike liquid crystal displays, OLED displays do not require a backlight and consume very little power, making them suitable for battery-powered devices. See also LEP.

OLTP (online transaction processing)

A mode of processing that is characterized by short transactions recording business events and that normally requires high availability and consistent, short response times. This category of applications requires that a request for service be answered within a predictable period that approaches “real time.” Unlike traditional mainframe data processing, in which data is processed only at specific times, transaction processing puts terminals online, where they can update the database instantly to reflect changes as they occur. In other words, the data processing models the actual business in real time, and a transaction transforms this model from one business state to another. Tasks such as making reservations, scheduling and inventory control are especially complex; all the information must be current.

OLTP monitor

Midrange system software designed to enhance the efficiency of online transaction-processing applications by providing screen mapping, transaction queuing, service prioritization, communications buffering and security.

OLTP screen-formatting front end

A cooperative processing facility that offloads screen formatting from a midrange system-resident online transaction processing (OLTP) system to a PC. The application programmer should be able to define a single set of screen-formatting maps without regard to whether the formatting is performed at the midrange system or at the PC.

OMA (Open Mobile Alliance)

Industry open-standards forum set up to facilitate global user adoption of mobile data services by ensuring service interoperability across devices, geographies, service providers, operators and networks. See also Open Mobile Alliance.

OMS (opportunity management system)

A system tied closely to the sales process; it is the framework for any sales force automation (SFA) design. All other applications are subordinate to the OMS. Transactions flow from the OMS to other applications on the users’ portable computers. Applications can be integrated among vendors.

OMS (order management system)

Provides the order-taking capability within the supply chain environment. The OMS typically provides the orders to a warehouse management system for execution – i.e., picking, packing and shipping.

OO (object-oriented or object orientation)

An umbrella concept used to describe a suite of technologies that enable software to be highly modular and reusable; applications, data, networks and computing systems are treated as objects that can be mixed and matched flexibly rather than as components of a system with built-in relationships. As a result, an application need not be tied to a specific system or data to a specific application. The four central object-oriented concepts are encapsulation, message passing, inheritance and late binding.

OOA&D (object-oriented analysis and design)

Object-oriented analysis and design (OOA&D) tools support object analysis and design technologies and commonly use Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation with a variety of methodologies to assist in the creation of highly modular and reusable software. Most also support the use of Domain Specific Language concepts as a complement to UML. Applications, data, networks and computing systems are treated as objects that can be mixed and matched flexibly rather than as components of a system with built-in relationships. As a result, an application does not need to be tied to a specific system or data to a specific application.

Please note that the UML standard from Object Management Group (OMG) has become the de facto standard for OOA&D tools.

OODBMS (object-oriented database management system)

A database management system (DBMS) that applies concepts of object-oriented programming, and applies them to the management of persistent objects on behalf of multiple users, with capabilities for security, integrity, recovery and contention management. An OODBMS is based on the principles of “objects,” namely abstract data types, classes, inheritance mechanisms, polymorphism, dynamic binding and message passing.

OOP (object-oriented programming)

A style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods. It is a technique based on a mathematical discipline, called “abstract data types,” for storing data with the procedures needed to process that data. OOP offers the potential to evolve programming to a higher level of abstraction.

OOT (object-oriented technology)

A software design model in which objects contain both data and the instructions that work on the data. It is increasingly deployed in distributed computing.

open architecture

A technology infrastructure with specifications that are public as opposed to proprietary. This includes officially approved standards as well as privately designed architectures, the specifications of which are made public by their designers. The IBM PC, for example, was based on an open architecture, and spawned an entire industry of IBM clones.

open source

Describes software that comes with permission to use, copy and distribute, either as is or with modifications, and that may be offered either free or with a charge. The source code must be made available.

open-source software

The open-source software model describes a set of characteristics and properties for developing, delivering and supporting software. Open source is licensed software in which the source code is made available to users so that they are enabled with the freedom to modify it for their own purposes and, with very limited restrictions, redistribute original and derived works as they see fit.

Open-source software comes with permission to use, modify, copy and distribute, either freely or for a small charge. The source code must be made available. Restrictions are often applied, through an “open-source license” such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, to profits or fees for any commercial product built on a base of open-source software.open system

A system whose interfaces – for example, application programming interfaces (APIs) or protocols – conform to formal, multilateral, generally available industry standards. “Formal” implies that the standard is selected and maintained using a structured, public process (i.e., de facto standards, such as those developed by the Open Software Foundation). “Multilateral” implies that, while nothing is ever completely vendor-neutral, the standard is not controlled by a single vendor. “Generally available” implies that the specifications are fully published (preferably with source code of a reference implementation), and that anyone can readily obtain license rights for free or at low cost.

operational resource management

A method for acquiring a better view into the cost of goods and services to yield enterprisewide financial control that streamlines the maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) procurement process (indirect goods) and supply chain control.

operations services

These services handle the transfer of all or part of the day-to-day system management responsibility for a customer’s IT infrastructure (host/data center, client/desktop or connectivity/network) and, in some cases, the transfer of ownership of the technology or personnel assets to an outside vendor. Services may include systems operation or support, administration, security, performance monitoring, technical diagnostics/troubleshooting, configuration management, system repair management, and generation of management reports. Also included are services to manage and implement business continuation processes and the management of technology assets.

operational technologies

The definition of operational technologies include:

• Systems that deal with the actual running of plant and equipment
• Devices to ensure physical system integrity and to meet technical constraints
• Event-driven and frequently real-time software applications or devices with embedded software

optical disc

A disk read or written by light, generally laser light; such a disk may store video, audio or digital data.

optical transport

The transport function relates to the high-capacity system that aggregates traffic and links network nodes over relatively long distances. It provides the paths (or “pipes”) along which the switching and routing functions steer information. It does so using technologies such as Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)/Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), digital cross-connects (DXCs)/digital cross-connect systems (DCSs), long-haul dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM), metro wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), and optical exchange equipment (OXE), including reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs), as well as carrier Ethernet transport equipment. Along with multiplexing technology, cross-connect technology is covered here rather than in the switching category because it is used to patch links that are rerouted as needed and, therefore, considered as “provisioning” technology.

optimization routines

Routines used to determine the optimal solution for a particular problem. These routines are included in supply chain execution and supply chain planning applications to reduce costs or time in the supply chain, and usually are tactically focused for use in current operations.

option analysis

A statistical technique based on the idea that changes over time will affect the cost and benefit of a future IT investment. If it has no option to change the decision, the IT organization must abide by the original decision. However, by creating an option for a decision in the future, the IT organization can choose to pursue IT investments that are then deemed profitable.

ORB (object request broker)

ORBs are an enriched middleware platform – compared with their predecessors, RPC middleware – including program activation, which most RPCs did not offer. Full-featured CORBA ORBs are transactional platforms, with a special affinity for the object-oriented programming model, including the activation and communications services that are particularly geared to the object-oriented software model. ORB vendors added transaction management, security and other features to their ORBs to enable demanding production applications. OMG CORBA emerged as the widely shared standard programming model for ORBs.

order management

Order management is a business process, not a specific market. Much of the functionality attributed to order management is embedded within and touches components within the CRM, ERP and SCM markets as it guides products and services through order entry, processing and tracking.

ORM (object role modeling)

A proprietary method that uses English to convey data design elements. The object is to enable developers to easily present the elements to end users who are unfamiliar with modeling notation.

ORM (operational resource management)

A method of managing of an organization’s operating resources.

OR mapping tools (object-relational mapping tools)

Tools that attempt to automate the mapping from object-oriented (OO) programming structures to relational storage structures. They are similar in intent to application integration middleware, which is designed to enable the interoperation of heterogeneous systems. However, they are different in the following important ways:

• The mapping layer is not runtime software that can be adjusted after deployment. OR mapping is done at development time, producing a compiled translation between objects and relational database management systems (RDBMSs).

OR mapping tools map between data models, application integration middleware maps, message protocols and occasionally message contents. In this way, OR mapping tools seek to integrate at a deeper level than most other forms of middleware.

OS (operating system)

An OS is software that, after being loaded into the computer by an initial boot program, manages a computer’s resources, controlling the flow of information into and from a main processor. OSs perform complex tasks, such as memory management, control of displays and other input/output peripheral devices, networking and file management, and other resource allocation functions between software and system components. The OS provides the foundation on which applications, middleware and other infrastructure components function. OS usually provides user interfaces, such as command-line shell and GUI, for interaction between user and computer.

OS revenue is tracked for analyzing the changing popularity of different platforms provided by software vendors. We track the following key subsegments in OS:

• Unix
• Linux
• Windows
• Others

With the recent emergence of application servers, Java EE and .NET have almost become operating environments or deployment environments. At this time, however, we classify Java EE products as infrastructure applications that run on particular underlying OS deployment environments, such as Windows, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, Linux and others. Client OSs run on stand-alone devices, such as desktops and laptops, and are designed to be used by a single individual on a single device. Server OSs run on more powerful hardware, often with multiple CPUs or multicore CPUs, and are designed to be accessed by many users in a shared fashion simultaneously.

With the advent of virtualization technologies, many OSs are deployed and reside in the form of a virtual machine (VM). Many users consider VMware, Xen and Hyper-V to be OSs because they perform hardware control functions that an OS will normally do. Virtualization software is classified as a segment separate from the other OS subsegments.

Osaifu Keitai (literally “wallet mobile phone”)

Mobile phones available in Japan that contain an embedded FeliCa NFC card. This enables the mobile phone to be used for many forms of e-commerce, including train tickets, mobile payments, vending machines, membership services and identification for building entry. NTT DoCoMo first introduced these devices in 2005, followed by other major Japanese operators, such as KDDI and SoftBank Mobile, in the same year. See also FeliCa.

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)

A model developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for communications. It is similar in structure to Systems Network Architecture (SNA), but more open. A standard, modular approach to network design that divides the required set of complex functions into manageable, self-contained, functional layers. These layers, starting from the innermost, are:

Physical layer – concerned with the mechanical and electrical means by which devices are physically connected and data is transmitted.
Link layer – concerned with how to move data reliably across the physical data link.
Network layer – provides the means to establish, maintain and terminate connections between systems. Concerned with switching and routing information.
Transport layer – concerned with end-to-end data integrity and quality of service.
Session layer – standardizes the task of setting up a session and terminating it. Coordinates the interaction between end application processes.
Presentation layer – relates to the character set and data code that is used, and to the way data is displayed on a screen or printer.
Application layer – concerned with the higher-level functions that support application or system activities.

OSI management

The facilities to control, coordinate and monitor the resources that enable communications in an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) environment.

Outsourcing is divided into the following domains, which represent type of outsourcing for ITO and the business process outsourced for BPO:

• ITO
• Data center outsourcing
• Desktop outsourcing
• Network outsourcing
• Enterprise application outsourcing
• BPO
• Supply management
• Operations
• Enterprises services
• Customer management

overlay

Installation of a networking component that is noninvasive to the wired infrastructure. Overlays generally employ tunneling techniques that connect end-point functionality to a central controller offering a variety of data, management and control plane functions.

OXE (optical exchange equipment)

In much of the literature addressing optical networking, terms such as optical cross-connect, optical switch and photonic switch have been used ambiguously. Many companies – including startups – confused the nomenclature during the “optical bubble” of 2000 when trying to improve their position and make their brands more recognizable in the optical networking arena. To avoid confusion and inaccuracy, OXE is used as a common term for any type of node equipment that handles traffic in the optical domain without relying on client-layer functionality.

The most common type of OXE in use today is the ROADM.

Standardization efforts relating to OXE, which have mainly focused on control plane features and associated signaling protocols, have been undertaken by various standardization bodies. They include:

• GMPLS from the IETF.
• ASTN/ASON from the ITU-T.
• User-Network Interface (UNI)/Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) from the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF).

Partition (See Volume)

Partition Table

partition table…SFS Win2K dynamic disk

partitioning code

Applications can be broken into three logical parts – presentation, logic and data. These are areas in which the program can be separated to facilitate execution of each logical piece on a different machine. Each segment is known as a partition. For example, the thin-client Web model requires that interface presentation be handled by the browser, application logic by the Web server and other application servers, and data by a database server. Developers are responsible for determining where the separation occurs.

A certificate server only releases the required certificate when an authorized user makes a request. Using PDE, each page of the document is encrypted and associated with a unique security certificate, allowing for selective retrieval.

PDM (product data management)

PDM technologies and products have historically been positioned as the primary application backbone for managing and controlling the flow of design intent across the three major design stages: concept design, detail design and production. But in practice, PDM has served as a complementary application tower to computer-aided design (CAD) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems by providing the main repository for production-approved engineering data (i.e., vaulting) and managing the changes to production – approved data (e.g., engineering change orders and configuration management). PDM is a key enabler for constructing a concurrent art-to-product environment (CAPE) for enterprisewide design and production. A well-constructed PDM enables all participants involved with the capture, communication and maintenance of design intent to freely share and disseminate all heterogeneous data related to the product. PDM evolved from the need to better manage paper, electronic documents, engineering change orders, and bills of materials during the product development process.

Pico projectors can be implemented using several technologies, including liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) imaging chips with LED illumination, MEMS DLP technology or laser diffraction.

platform-independent

Software that can run on a variety of hardware platforms or software architectures. Platform-independent software can be used in many different environments, requiring less planning and translation across an enterprise. For example, the Java programming language was designed to run on multiple types of hardware and multiple operating systems. If Java platform-independence becomes a reality, organizations with multiple types of computers will be able to write a specialized application once and have it be used by virtually everyone, rather than having to write, distribute and maintain multiple versions of the same program.

PLC (programmable logic controller)

The fundamental building block of factory and process automation. A specialty purpose computer, including input/output processing and serial communications, used for executing control programs, especially control logic and complex interlock sequences. PLCs can be embedded in machines or process equipment by OEMs, used stand-alone in local control environments or networked in system configurations.

Podcast

Audio (or audio and video) content specifically designed for synchronizing and playback on mobile audio players, such as Apple’s iPod and MP3 playback-enabled mobile phones. Much of this content is highly topical, derived from radio or TV broadcasts, and it is often free. Podcasts are an example of “sticky” content: listeners are encouraged to subscribe to a podcast “channel” that typically is updated with new content daily or weekly. See also mobisode.

portal

A high-traffic Web site with a wide range of content, services and vendor links. It acts as a value-added middleman by selecting the content sources and assembling them in a simple-to-navigate and customize interface for presentation to the end user. Portals typically offer such services as Web searching, news, reference tools, access to online shopping venues, and communications capabilities including e-mail and chat rooms.

portal-enabling middleware

The toolset for a portal including the platform middleware and the integration and context management tools.

portals and user interaction tools

Organizations use both portal and other user interface products to provide access to, and interaction with, relevant information, applications, business processes and human resources for select targeted audiences. Especially where these are provided by portals, these can be delivered in a highly personalized manner. Horizontal portal products can be used to create portals facing a variety of external and internal audience types. A modern portal product is programmable and thus performs platform middleware functions. Increasingly, it also includes integration middleware functions, such as transformation and intelligent routing (that is, it can include some form of basic integration suite). Modern horizontal portal products often include at least limited support for Web content management and collaboration features and often come with an embedded search engine.

portfolio management

A shift from the practice of using a single integrated application for the support of business requirements to using a collection of applications, technologies and services to create a system that addresses the unique requirements of an organization and leverages best-of-breed opportunities.

porting

Modifying code that runs on one hardware platform or operating system so that it will properly execute on another hardware platform or operating system.

POS (point of sale)

POS systems use personal computers or specialized terminals in combination with cash registers, optical scanners or magnetic-stripe readers to capture and record data at the time of transaction. POS systems are usually online to a central computer for credit checking and inventory updating. Alternatively, they may be independent systems that store daily transactions until they can be transmitted to the central system for processing.

POS (point of service)

A type of health maintenance organization (HMO) plan that offers limited coverage for care received outside the HMO’s network.

POSIX

An acronym (pronounced like positive) for Portable Operating System Interface, suggested by Richard M. Stallman. It is a set of international standards (ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996(E), ANSI/IEEE Std 1003.1 1996 Edition) to interface with Unix-like exploitation systems, e.g. Linux. NTFS does not support Unix-like device files.

postpaid connection

A contract that includes airtime and is paid for at scheduled intervals (generally monthly).

PPM (project and portfolio management)

PPM applications address business processes with functions across multiple domains, which include:

• Planning and scheduling
• Tracking time and progress
• Program management
• Resource profiling and allocation
• Portfolio analysis and prioritization

The PPM market deals with a hierarchy of functions, roles and standards that range from the planning and execution of projects through their interaction with the enterprise’s strategic goals.

PPM applications address such foundational project management areas as those described in the Project Management Institute’s Project Management Body of Knowledge:

• Time management, resource management and cost management
• Scope management, procurement management and communications management
• Risk management and quality management

PPM applications also support an integrated view across the portfolio of project work as well as nonproject work. This integrated view is a key input to portfolio prioritization.

PPM applications can deal further with collections of projects assembled into large-scale programs, with functions to support the integrated planning of multiple, dependent projects, with a view of cross-project dependencies, program-level budgets, costs, schedules and resource plans. Flexible reporting of program data to various organizational levels is also supported.

A PPM application is often used by a business-unit level project/program management office (PMO) and/or an enterprise-level PMO to define, capture, maintain, analyze and report on data about initiatives’ current state, costs and progress, as well as variances from plans and expectations. Organizational resource information can be grouped into taxonomies of roles, functions and skill sets, thus allowing for better tracking of resource assignment and utilization.

At a strategic level, portfolio management features support decision making that aligns initiative investments with business goals. Functions provide BI on project or service delivery and dashboard views of initiative alignment, status, resource capacity, service levels and more. Integration with other enterprise applications can leverage data from various segments of the business to help users manage their pipelines, report and forecast initiatives’ progress, analyze portfolio alternatives, and prioritize.

predictive behavior analysis

The use of techniques such as data mining, data visualization, algorithm clustering, and neural networking to find patterns or trends in data. These patterns or trends are used to forecast future behavior based on current or past behavior. Uses of predictive behavior analysis include identifying customers likely to drop out or default; identifying products customers are likely to buy next; developing customer segments or groups; and product development.

prerelational DBMS

DBMS architectures were defined before relational theory became widely used. The prerelational DBMS generally is based on a hierarchical structure or a navigational (also known as network) structure.

print markets and management hardware

This segment includes copiers and printers.

• Copiers – Copiers perform image capture and transfer. This category includes analog (optical technology) and digital (digital scanning and printing technology) copiers.
• Printers – A printer is the peripheral output device of a computer system for producing computer-generated images on paper using various marking technologies. To be classified in this segment, the device needs to be capable of using plain or coated papers with a minimum size of International Organization for Standardization A4, U.S. size A (letter) or continuous forms with an 8-inch print width or greater, but it excludes products that support paper widths above A2 or U.S. size C (17 inches by 22 inches). The definition also excludes other classes of application-specific printers, such as point-of-sale printers, video printers and dedicated photo printers.

private key

The confidential half of the asymmetric key pair used in public-key cryptography. Unlike the “secret key” used in symmetric-key cryptography – a single key known by both the sender and the receiver – a private key is known only by the recipient. See public-key cryptography and secret-key cryptography.

PRM (partner relationship management)

The customer relationship management (CRM) element that extends sales, marketing, customer service and other enterprise business functions to partners to foster more-collaborative channel partner relationships.

problem management

The core function of a customer service and support (CSS) application used by call centers. It coordinates a multitier, multiowner service and support environment, enables pattern analysis, provides management reports, and facilitates requesting additional service and support resources by providing hard numbers on the service workload and its changing nature. Because PM tools can also track service-level agreements (SLAs), they are valuable for monitoring compliance.

process control

The regulation of variables that influence or control the conduct of a process so that a specified quality and quantity of product are obtained.

process management

Specific to the communications environment, the practice of telecom expense management (TEM) encompasses the business processes conducted by IT and finance departments to acquire the provision (and support) of corporate telecommunications assets. Put another way, TEM is the build-out of services, or the acquisition of third-party services, to manage the supply chain for telecommunications. The component services of TEM as is identified as: sourcing, ordering and provisioning, inventory management, invoice and contract management, use management, dispute management, and business intelligence.

process manufacturing

Manufacturing that adds value by performing chemical reactions or physical actions to transform materials, or by extracting, mixing, separating or forming materials in batch or continuous production modes.

processing, batch

A method of computer operation in which a number of similar input items are accumulated and sorted for processing.

processing, line

The processing of transactions as they occur, with no preliminary editing or sorting before they enter the system.

process management

A management concept that describes the goal of increasing intraenterprise coordination of separate business functions. Business process re-engineering is a form of process management that focuses on replacing traditional functions (e.g., sales, marketing and service) with functionally integrated processes (e.g., customer relationship management). The growth in the demand for enterprise software reflects the need for increased integration and sharing of business information throughout an enterprise.

procurement

Procurement applications are used to help companies understand and improve the terms and conditions of trade and to comprehend enterprise spending. These applications assist in supplier selection, the analysis of supplier performance, and the establishment of the terms of trade to balance cost, quality and risk. Typical modules and applications include:

• E-procurement
• Strategic sourcing
• Procurement business process hubs
• Contract management
• Tactical sourcing (request for quotation)
• Spending analysis
• Buy-side catalog management
• Supply base management

product support services

Product support services refer to labor-based services for hardware or software, which can be performed by the manufacturer of the product or parties other than the vendor that created the product. These services can be provided by several types of vendors, typically including hardware OEMs, such as Dell, HP, EMC or IBM; and software publishers, such as Microsoft, Oracle or SAP. Formal channel partners of hardware and software vendors also provide support services.

Product support services are also delivered by additional independent service providers and third-party support providers. An independent service provider delivers a broad range of services for hardware and/or software products (such as consulting or support), and may have an alliance with the product manufacturer but not as a primary means to its service business. A third-party support provider primarily delivers break/fix technical support for hardware and/or software products and is not typically aligned with the product manufacturer but may have a relationship in certain specific exceptional cases.

production devices

Production devices encompass printers, stand-alone copiers and MFPs featuring a printing speed of more than 70 ppm in both monochrome and color. Production printers perform three specific types of printing:

• Transaction printing includes statements, bills, notices and other transactional documents that are printed in large volumes. With the growth of color print, transaction printing is merging into direct marketing with promotional and marketing pieces with the inclusion of personalized color items as well. “Transpromo” refers to transactional documents that have a promotional message or third-party advertising on them.
• Direct marketing, such as direct-mail packages.
• Publishing that includes short-run printing, print on demand (POD) booklets, catalogs, manuals and brochures, which are printed on an as-needed basis. POD is also being used to print books that are published in limited volumes.

project management

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.

project management office (PMO)

A project management office (PMO) is usually created to solve a specific problem: generally, the IT organization’s inability to deliver IT projects on time, on budget and in scope. Project managers may “live” in the PMO, or in different IT units, such as in application development or in the business.

$PROPERTY_SET

obsolete

proprietary software

Software that is owned by an organization or an individual, as opposed to “public-domain software,” which is freely distributed. The explosion in the use of the Internet has expanded the reach of public-domain software since it is now much easier to transmit these programs. While many commercial software developers have developed software that has become the de facto standard (e.g., Microsoft’s Windows programs), proprietary software that is based on proprietary protocols, or standards, can create obstacles for applications development and usage.

protocol

A set of procedures in telecommunications connections that the terminals or nodes use to send signals back and forth. Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the standard protocol for the Internet and related networks such as intranets and extranets. Local-area networks (LANs) often rely on a different protocol. Networks and systems cannot communicate unless they use the same protocol or make use of a gateway.

protocol conversion

The process of translating the protocol native to an end-user device (e.g., a terminal) into a different protocol (e.g., ASCII to BSC), allowing that end-user device to communicate with another device (e.g., a computer) with which it would otherwise be incompatible. Protocol conversion can be performed by a dedicated device (a protocol converter); by a software package loaded onto an existing system, such as a general-purpose computer, front-end processor, or private branch exchange (PBX) system; or by a value-added network, such as Telenet.

protocol stack

A defined protocol with options applicable for specific functions that can be implemented as a product. Also called a functional standard or functional profile.

protocol-transparent

Refers to a device’s capability to perform its function independent of the communications protocol.

proxy agent

A network management agent that comes between an unmanaged device and a management system, allowing management by proxy, i.e., on behalf of the device.

proxy servers

Devices that process and filter all Internet Protocol (IP) packets that are directed to them and decide which protocols and services can be served out of their caches. Proxy servers tend to offer the greatest range of protocol and caching support since they cache Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTPS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and, in some cases, streaming content such as RealAudio and PointCast. Each workstation addresses the proxy server directly by setting specific parameters in each browser on each workstation.

PSA (professional services administration)

The integration of planning, resource management, project management and project accounting for service organizations.

PSK (phase-shift keying)

Phase modulation that uses discrete, present changes of phase.

PTR (peak transaction rate)

Total number of wireless transactions by all mobile devices during a specified period of time per access point.

PTT PoC (push-to-talk over cellular)

OMA-defined specification for the delivery of PTT walkie-talkie services over a packet radio network, typically GPRS.

public key

The public half of the asymmetric key pair used in public-key cryptography (see separate entry).

public-key cryptography

An encryption technique developed to overcome the limitations of secret-key cryptography (see separate entry). Public key (also called “asymmetric key”) cryptography uses two mathematically related keys: A public key to encrypt messages, and a private key to decrypt them. In a public-key system, you communicate privately by encrypting your message using the public key of your intended recipient. Although everyone else knows the recipient’s public key, it is useless for decrypting a message encrypted with it. Only the corresponding private key, known only to the recipient, can decrypt the message.

publish and subscribe

A communication pattern in which information sources “publish” (i.e., send) information to a somewhat intelligent middleware infrastructure, and information consumers “subscribe” by specifying what kind of information they want to receive from the infrastructure. The middleware must be able to physically transport messages from one or more publishers to one or more subscribers. It also must be smart enough to find the proper destinations by matching each message to subscription criteria. This model naturally supports one-to-many or many-to-many communication – in contrast to either message passing or message queuing, both of which mostly (but not entirely) aim at one-to-one communication.

publish/subscribe architecture

Processes that acquire or receive messages from source applications and publish these messages on a systemwide bulletin board or, in alternative terminology, put them on a software bus where all other processes can “see” them. Application processes generally indicate which messages they are interested in by supplying one or more rules to the integration broker (IB). Also described as a software bus architecture.

pull

All activities being undertaken within the lean enterprise according to and at the rate of the actual demand requirements of the end consumer.

pull printing

Also called “follow-me printing,” pull printing allows for a print job to be sent to a pull-printing server, which delivers the print job to the printer. This frees up the user’s computer for other tasks and reduces network traffic. Word-processing documents and even Web pages (referred to as Web pull printing) can be pull-printed without having the file opened on the user’s computer. The user sends the document’s location to the pull-printing server for processing.

pulse carrier

A series of identical pulses intended for modulation.

push technology

Software that automates the delivery of information to users. In contrast, the Web is a “pull” environment that requires a user to seek information.

In a “push” environment, information is sent to a person proactively, through a Web browser, e-mail, or even voice mail or a pager. In business, push technology can be used for the conveyance of time-sensitive information, like changes in commodity pricing or the introduction of promotional programs to a sales force. Enterprises can employ push technology to communicate externally with their clients or internally with their employees over a network.

PWM (pulse width modulation)

A method of encoding information based on variations of the duration of carrier pulses. Also called pulse duration modulation (PDM).

PX (private exchange)

R

RAAD (rapid architected applications development)

An approach to large-scale applications development (AD) that includes the following phases, which are executed by up to 10 teams of 10 people each during a period of no more than 18 months:

• Phase 1: Business and technical architecture reconciliation.
• Phase 2: Functional requirements gathering and specification.
• Phase 3: Initial architecture design, building and implementation.
• Phase 4: First building and testing of application, including user interface, data access and business logic.
• Phase 5: Initial installation of application.
• Phase 6: Concurrent engineering for subsequent builds.
• Phase 7: Rapid release plan.

rack

A framework or structure that holds computer servers or networking equipment, usually by means of shelves or mounting plates. The height of computer equipment is expressed in rack units (U), which equal the distance between shelf increments in a standard rack (see rack unit).

rack density

The rack density describes the height of a unit. The standard height of one unit is 1.75 inches, so rack density is described in terms of the number of units, such as one unit (1U), 2U and so on. Blade servers are noted as “number of blades per blade chassis/height” (in standard U height), so 14 blades per blade chassis height of 7U would be listed as “14/7U.”

rack mount

• Rack mountable – A system that can be mounted in a rack or as a stand-alone
• Rack-Optimized – A system that has to be run in a server cabinet
• Tower/stand-alone – A system optimized for stand-alone installation only
• Blade – A discrete CPU card that slides vertically into a shared chassis. Typically several blade cards are housed in a cabinet or a stand-alone chassis, which houses a common power supply, cooling element, and network switches and connections.

rack unit (RU)

A standard increment used to express the height of a piece of rack-mounted computer or networking equipment, abbreviated as “U” and equal to 1.75 inches. For example, a server with a height of 4U takes up seven inches of vertical rack space. The most common dimensions for an industry-standard rack are 42U (73.5 inches) high and 19 inches wide.

RAD (rapid application development)

An application development (AD) approach that includes small teams (typically two to six people, but never more than 10) using joint application development (JAD) and iterative-prototyping techniques to construct interactive systems of low to medium complexity within a time frame of 60 to 120 days.

radio PAD (radio packet assembler/disassembler)

PAD with an integrated radio transceiver for use with packet radio systems.

RAID (redundant array of independent disks)

A method of mirroring or striping data on clusters of low-end disk drives; data is copied onto multiple drives for faster throughput, error correction, fault tolerance and improved mean time between failures.

With the exception of RAID 0, all RAID levels provide automated recovery of data in the event of a disk failure. The RAID levels and their key features are:

• RAID-0 – provides disk striping without parity information; data is written by segment across multiple disks sequentially until the end of the array is reached, and then writing starts at the beginning again. Provides greater logical disk capacity with faster access time on reads (multiple segments read simultaneously). However, RAID-0 provides no data redundancy – if one drive fails, the entire disk array subsystem is unavailable.
• RAID-1 – provides fault tolerance by using disk mirroring (also called shadowing). Each byte of data on a disk is duplicated on another physical drive, providing 100 percent data redundancy. RAID-1 provides immediate access to data when either the primary or secondary drive fails, but it has the highest cost of all RAID types, since duplicate hardware is required.
• RAID-2 – eliminates the 100 percent redundancy overhead of RAID-1 by using a powerful error detection and correction code (Hamming), with bits of the data pattern written across multiple disks.
• RAID-3 – similar to RAID-2, but uses a single check disk per group that contains the bit parity of the data disks; data is interleaved across all disks. Because disk reads are performed across the entire array and all data is transferred to the controller in parallel, RAID-3 is well suited for applications that require high data read/write transfer rates for large sequential files.
• RAID-4 – instead of interleaving blocks of data across all drives, writes the first block on drive 1, the second block on drive 2, and so on. This technique dramatically improves read time, since many reads are single block (single drive), freeing other drives for additional read requests.
• RAID-5 – eliminates the dedicated parity drive by writing parity with the data across all drives in the array. Consequently, the single-write restriction and some performance degradation of RAID-1 through RAID-4 are eliminated. If a drive fails, the controller can rebuild the data from the parity and data on the remaining drives.
• RAID-6 – provides two-disk parity and one spare, so that two simultaneous disk failures per array of disks can be tolerated. With the occurrence of a failure, a spare is brought online and transparent reconstruction begins automatically in the background with negligible impact on performance.
• RAID-10 – a combination of RAID-0 and RAID-1 that provides the benefits of striping and fault tolerance (disk mirroring).

RAS (reliability, availability and serviceability)

A reference to a product’s quality, availability of optional features, and ease of diagnosis and repair.

RBISO (role-based IS organization)

A distributed type of IS organization that represents an association of multiple IS organizational styles and sources fulfill different roles for the enterprise. Instead of a single, integrated IT function within the enterprise, this newer RBISO encompasses consultants, business liaisons, resource pools and services.

RDBMS (relational database management system)

A database management system (DBMS) that incorporates the relational-data model, normally including a Structured Query Language (SQL) application programming interface. It is a DBMS in which the database is organized and accessed according to the relationships between data items. In a relational database, relationships between data items are expressed by means of tables. Interdependencies among these tables are expressed by data values rather than by pointers. This allows a high degree of data independence.

RDM (requirements definition and management)

Requirements definition and management (RDM) tools streamline development teams’ analysis of requirements, capture requirements in a database-based tool to enable collaborative review for accuracy and completeness, ease use-case and/or test-case creation, provide traceability, and facilitate documentation and versioning/change control. Increasingly, RDM tools support business analysts with graphical tools for process workflow definition, application simulation and prototyping, and other visual, collaborative tools. The database approach uses special-purpose repositories that are part of the requirements management solution or ship with a general-purpose commercial database integrated with the tool.

real time

The description for an operating system that responds to an external event within a short and predictable time frame. Unlike a batch or time-sharing operating system, a real-time operating system provides services or control to independent ongoing physical processes. It typically has interrupt capabilities (so that a less important task can be put aside) and a priority-scheduling management scheme.

receiver sensitivity

Measurement of the weakest signal that a wireless receiver can receive and still translate into data. Receiver sensitivity is affected greatly by a number of factors, including location and placement within the wireless device.

record management

The systematic organization and managed storage of diverse information sources through the end of their life cycles. Record management can be viewed as a subset of integrated document management (IDM) and is one of the five most important IDM library service functions. The others are check-in/check-out, version control, document-level security and attribute, and full-text index search and retrieval.

redundancy

Portion of the total information contained in a message that can be eliminated without loss of essential information.
Provision of duplicate, backup equipment or links that immediately take over the function of equipment or transmission lines that fail.

relational DBMS

The RDBMS architecture is based on a formal method of constructing a database in rows and columns using rules that have formal mathematical proofs. RDBMSs originated in the work of E.F. Codd. In an RDBMS, relationships among tables are created by comparing data, such as account numbers and names. In addition, an RDBMS has the flexibility to take any two or more tables and generate a new table from the rows that meet the matching criteria.

RDBMSs are implemented in many different ways. For example, they can be implemented on disk storage using relational or row storage techniques, stored as columns or indexes as in column-based storage, implemented in memory as the in-memory storage model, and even implemented in flash memory. In addition, RDBMS engines are available with different footprints that can be used as embedded DBMS engines in edge devices, as well as in portable or mobile devices. We also do not distinguish data types any longer because most RDBMSs available today allow multiple data types, including objects, user-defined data types, BLOBs and native XML structures.

repeatable solutions

Replicable, integrated solutions to a specific process improvement or application requirement. A repeatable solution typically exhibits the following characteristics:

• Fixed pricing, sometimes with a shared business-benefit upside.
• Fixed delivery schedule with rapid implementation.
• Specified performance.
• Initial pilot solution with rapid prototype, followed by roll-out and incremental additions.
• A prime contractor with one point of contact for the client.
• Long-standing and battle-proven partner relationships.
• Joint research and development (R&D) and joint marketing among the partners.
• Opportunity for residual values in the form of royalties, licensing, etc.

Repeatable solutions, as the basis for the portfolio of technology solutions (POTS), must be targeted at specific processes, technologies, subindustries or topical issues. They require high-end professional services such as business process re-engineering, system and network integration and software customization.

repository

A facility for storing descriptions and behaviors of objects in an enterprise, including requirements, policies, processes, data, software libraries, projects, platforms and personnel, with the potential of supporting both software development and operations management. As a single point of definition for all system resources, it should stimulate both program and installation management productivity. A system repository would include configuration definitions, tuning parameters and performance goals, while an application repository would include data definitions.

residential/small-office gateway/router with embedded DSL modem

This device is part of a home networking solution for residential consumers, but can also be used in a small office/home office (SOHO) environment. It can be a wired device or include a wireless access point. Most residential/SOHO gateways incorporate a built-in DSL modem, routing functionality, a wireless access point and a firewall.

The time period between a terminal operator’s completion of an inquiry and the receipt of a response. Response time includes the time taken to transmit the inquiry, process it by the computer, and transmit the response back to the terminal. Response time is frequently used as a measure of the performance of an interactive system.

retail sales

This category includes the additional collection of sales applications required for a retail environment. It includes point-of-sale applications for recording sales transactions, usually a cash register and merchandising software.

retirements

Number of mobile devices ceasing to be in use during a given year. The retirements figure is complicated by the existence of secondhand equipment. When a used mobile device from one region is sold in another region in conjunction with a new connection, the device is not added to the sales-to-end-user line, but it is accounted for in the installed baseline. A high number of secondhand sales may lead to a negative figure for retirements.

reuse

An application development methodology that catalogs and makes available application components so that they may be incorporated into other applications.

revenue

Revenue consists of the gross billings generated by a vendor, measured in unit currency.

RFID (radio frequency identification)

Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an automated data collection technology that uses radio waves to transfer data between a tag and a reader to identify, track or locate the item attached to the tag. The transfer of data is then transmitted from the reader to a computer or server for processing and management. RFID does not need a line of sight or contact between the reader and the tag. The market is segmented into hardware and software.

RFID reader

An RFID reader is a radio frequency device that emits a signal through an antenna. This signal is received by RFID tags that respond to interrogation by the reader. Responses are read by the reader, and through a variety of protocols the reader can communicate with all the RFID tags in its field. Readers generally take three forms. Portal readers are fixed in one location; RFID tags pass through them and communicate with the reader. Handheld readers are portable devices that can communicate with RFID tags. Mounted readers are a special type, placed on mobile equipment such as forklifts and cranes. They often communicate with tags in fixed locations.

RFID tags

RFID tags are generally small devices that respond to an RFID reader’s interrogation via radio frequency. Tags vary in terms of memory, the range over which they can be read, the level of read and write capabilities, and the availability of other computational functions. The tag can hold just a product’s serial number all the way up to a mass of information about the product and its history.

Passive RFID

A passive RFID tag has no battery. It harvests all its power from the radio interrogation of the RFID reader, including enough power to respond. This yields fairly low-cost devices, but they can be read only at a fairly short range (about 20 feet in the best operating conditions).

Active RFID

Active tags have batteries attached to them so that they can respond to a reader with more power. They are much more expensive than passive tags but have a much-greater range (up to 300 feet).

Smart Cards

Contactless smart cards are often referred to as RFID tags. From a technical perspective, they are just a specially packaged form of RFID tags.

Sensors

RFID tags don’t tell you anything about their environment. They can only tell you what is in the memory of the tag. However, a common application of RFID is to attach the tag to a sensor that can fill the tag’s memory with data. This is then communicated to other systems through RFID protocols. The sensory technology, while intertwined with RFID, is independent.

RISC (reduced instruction set computer)

A processor architecture that shifts the analytical process of a computational task from the execution or runtime to the preparation or compile time. By using less hardware or logic, the system can operate at higher speeds. RISC cuts down on the number and complexity of instructions, on the theory that each one can be accessed and executed faster, and that less semiconductor real estate is required to process them. The result is that for any given semiconductor technology, a more powerful microprocessor can be produced with RISC than with complex instruction set computer (CISC) architectures.

This simplification of computer instruction sets gains processing efficiencies. That theme works because all computers and programs execute mostly simple instructions. RISC has five design principles:

• Single-cycle execution – In most traditional central processing unit (CPU) designs, the peak possible execution rate is one instruction per basic machine cycle, and for a given technology, the cycle time has some fixed lower limit. Even on complex CPUs, most compiler-generated instructions are simple. RISC designs emphasize single-cycle execution, even at the expense of synthesizing multi-instruction sequences for some less-frequent operations.
• Hard-wired control, little or no microcode – Microcode adds a layer of interpretive overhead, raising the number of cycles per instruction, so even the simplest instructions can require several cycles.
• Simple instructions, few addressing modes – Complex instructions and addressing modes, which entail microcode or multicycle instructions, are avoided.
• Load and store, register-register design – Only loads and stores access memory; all others perform register-register operations. This tends to follow from the previous three principles.
• Efficient, deep pipelining – To make convenient use of hardware parallelism without the complexities of horizontal microcode, fast CPUs use pipelining. An n-stage pipeline keeps up to “n” instructions active at once, ideally finishing one (and starting another) every cycle. The instruction set must be carefully tuned to support pipelining.

RM (relationship manager)

A staff member who acts as an organizational liaison, typically between an information services (IS) department and business-unit or function. The relationship manager may fulfill a combination of roles that correspond to the degree of trust and authority granted to the person in that role by his/her customer. The job content of the position (in order of increasing business trust and responsibility) is classified in four levels:

• Level 1: Inform and Communicate
• Level 2: Advise and Influence
• Level 3: Coordinate and Integrate
• Level 4: Manage and Oversee

Relationship management is essentially a matrixed position, with reporting requirements to at least two managers (typically a chief information officer – CIO – and business function or division manager). In practice, however, the position is usually linked more strongly to one side than another, and is most often aligned to the business management side.

RMA (record management application)

An application that enables enterprises to manage electronic and paper-based records throughout the life cycles of those records.

RNC (radio network controller)

Plays a role similar to the BSC in a GSM network, but supports B nodes used in UMTS networks.

roaming

Ability of a mobile user to access cellular services while away from the home network. This includes automated roaming between GSM networks, SIM-based roaming, where a user switches the SIM card into a mobile phone from a different network, or roaming across technologies (for example, between a WCDMA network and the GSM network of another operator). Roaming can take place within one country and across national boundaries. In a WLAN context, roaming occurs when a mobile device disassociates from one access point and then re-associates with a new access point.

ROC (return on competitiveness)

A nomenclature and philosophy that goes beyond the traditional return on investment (ROI) concept by focusing the metric or calculation on how competitiveness is affected by investment. A good way to visualize and quantify the overall return on IT competitiveness is to build a spider diagram that identifies and maps all the relevant dimensions of competitiveness within a given industry sector, and then measure the changes in the overall mapping area during a given time interval (e.g., a year).

ROE (return on equity)

A measure of a company’s financial performance (net income divided by the value of the stockholders’ equity, and expressed in percent).

ROI (return on investment)

Financial gain expressed as a percentage of funds invested to generate that gain.

ROIT (return on information technology)

Financial gain expressed as a function of an enterprise’s investment in information technology.

ROLAP (relational online analytical processing)

A relational approach to multidimensionality, offering multidimensional operations (initially read only) on top of relational data (heavily denormalized).

Roll-back

When an NTFS volume is mounted, it is checked to see if it is in a consistant state. If it isn’t then the $LogFile is consulted and transactions are undone until the disk returns to a consistant state. This does not guarantee data integrity, only disk integrity.

See also: $LogFile, Transaction and Volume.

Root Directory (See Dot, Root Directory)

RSA (rural service area)

Geographic area designation used for the allocation of 1,900MHz cellular licenses to mobile service providers in the U.S. that determines where they can operate. An RSA is a non-urban area. There are 306 MSAs and 428 RSAs in the U.S. There is considerable overlap with the older BTA and MTA designations. See also BTA, MSA and MTA.

RSTR Record

Two copies of this are in $LogFile. A restart area has the magic number ‘RSTR’ followed by a fixup and some other data, including three LSNs. A restart area has a pointer into the log area, such as the first and last log records written and the last checkpoint record written. (that is three – now which is which?)

RTT (round-trip time)

Measure (in milliseconds) of the latency of a network – that is, the time between initiating a network request and receiving a response. High latency tends to have a greater impact than bandwidth on the end-user experience in interactive applications, such as Web browsing. See also latency.

R-UIM (removable user identity module)

Introduced by the CDMA Development Group (CDG) and the 3GPP2, an R-UIM card is a smart card for use with CDMA-based mobile phones. It enables customers to switch phones without changing their mobile numbers, stores frequently called numbers and provides some functions similar to the SIM card in GSM mobile phones.

Products distributed by manufacturers into a country or region (“sell in”) – but not connected to networks in that region – are excluded. Conversely, products sold by a manufacturer to a distributor in one region but sold by that distributor in another region are counted as sales (“sell through”) to end users in the latter region.

SAM (software asset management)

A process for making software acquisition and disposal decisions. It includes strategies that identify and eliminate unused or infrequently used software, consolidating software licenses or moving toward new licensing models.

SAM tools (systems administration management tools)

A flexible set of application maintenance utilities and application administration tools. The key value of such tools is derived from how well they manage changes. A well-designed tool permits an administrator to describe either a database or a form field change, ensures the integrity of all of the application components tied to the change and propagates the change to all affected users. SAM tools for central administration are used by system administrators and thus provide a level of technical competency, whereas administrative functionality for managers (e.g., sales managers, marketing content managers and call center supervisors) must be limited by the capabilities of the end user.

SAN (storage area network)

A SAN consists of two tiers: The first tier – the storage plumbing tier – provides connectivity between nodes in a network and transports device-oriented commands and status. At least one storage node must be connected to this network. The second tier – the software tier – uses software to provide value-added services that operate over the first tier.

satellite dish

Parabolic microwave antenna used to transmit and receive satellite signals. On the downlink, the dish collects data or video signals from orbiting satellites and focuses them to where a feed horn collects them and passes the signal on to be amplified and sent to a satellite receiver or IRD. The term is derived from the shape of the reflector surface but also represents the entire antenna subsystem, including the feed horn and antenna structure.

satellite phone (satphone)

Handheld device that uses satellite infrastructure to effect wireless voice and SMS communications without the use of a terrestrial infrastructure. Satphones can be handheld, fixed or portable and use satellites that can be stationary or orbiting. The user requires line of sight to a satellite in the coverage area of the service provider. Services typically include two-way voice, low-speed data, SMS and fax. Satphone service providers include Globalstar, Inmarsat, Iridium Satellite and Thuraya.

SBM (skills-based management)

A program that objectively defines what skills an enterprise possesses, what skills it will need in the future, when it will need those skills, what strategic value it will place on those skills and how the information technology (IT) employees’ competency levels match the value of the strategically significant skills. It is, in effect, a road map for developing competency improvement programs and other methods to fill any skill gaps.

SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition)

A system used in manufacturing for acquiring measurements of process variables and machine states, and for performing regulatory or machine control across a process area or work cell.

scalability

The measure of a system’s ability to increase or decrease in performance and cost in response to changes in application and system processing demands. Examples would include how well a hardware system performs when the number of users is increased, how well a database withstands growing numbers of queries, or how well an operating system performs on different classes of hardware. Enterprises that are growing rapidly should pay special attention to scalability when evaluating hardware and software.

scanner

A device that resolves a two-dimensional object, such as a business document, into a stream of bits by raster scanning and quantization.

scattering

SCCM (software change and configuration management)

Software change and configuration management (SCCM – mainframe and distributed) tools implement a set of disciplines used to stabilize, track and control the versions and configurations of a set of software items and also may include development change management, defect tracking, change automation, development release management, integrated test management, integrated build management and other related processes.

SCE (supply chain execution)

Supply chain execution (SCE) is focused on execution-oriented applications, including warehouse management systems (WMSs), transportation management systems (TMSs), global trade management (GTM) systems and other execution applications, such as real-time decision support systems (for example, dynamic routing and dynamic sourcing systems) and supply chain visibility systems within the enterprise, as well as throughout the extended supply chain. Sometimes, order management systems are also included in SCE, but, generally, order management is not included in the definition of SCE. Typical modules and applications include:

• WMSs:
• Labor management systems
• Yard/dock management
• Returns management
• Inventory control
• TMSs:
• Domestic transportation management software
• Global multimodal transportation management (managing transportation around multimodal processes)
• GTM systems:
• Trade compliance
• International/global logistics
• Global order management
• Global trade financial management

SC-FDMA (single-carrier frequency division multiple access)

A multiplexing technique similar to OFDMA but where the subcarriers assigned to each user must be contiguous, which reduces the processing power and battery requirements for mobile devices. See also OFDMA.

SCIV (supply chain inventory visibility)

Applications that allow enterprises to monitor and manage events across the supply chain to plan their activities more effectively and pre-empt problems. SCIV systems enable enterprises not only to track and trace inventory globally on a line-item level, but also submit plans and receive alerts when events deviate from expectations. This visibility into orders and shipments on a real-time basis gives enterprises reliable advance knowledge of when goods will arrive.

SCM (software configuration management)

Also known as “software change management,” SCM is a methodology for software problem/change request initiation and tracking; change impact analysis; version control; security administration of software assets; software promotion; quality reviews; and software distribution.

SCM (supply chain management)

SCM is a business strategy to improve shareholder and customer value by optimizing the flow of products, services and related information from source to customer. SCM encompasses the processes of creating and fulfilling the market’s demand for goods and services. It is a set of business processes that encompasses a trading partner community engaged in a common goal of satisfying the end customer. Thus, a supply chain process can stretch from a supplier’s supplier to a customer’s customer.

At a high level, SCM software is segmented into planning, execution and procurement components. Planning typically deals with activities to develop demand forecasts, establish relations with suppliers, plan and schedule manufacturing, and develop metrics to ensure efficient and cost-effective operations. Execution functions manage the processes and activities to ensure completion of the plans, including creating purchase orders, taking customer orders, updating inventory, managing movement of products in the warehouse, and delivering goods to the customer. Procurement applications are used to help companies understand and improve the terms and conditions of trade to understand enterprise spending.

SCP (supply chain planning)

Supply chain planning (SCP) is the forward-looking process of coordinating assets to optimize the delivery of goods, services and information from supplier to customer, balancing supply and demand. An SCP suite sits on top of a transactional system to provide planning, what-if scenario analysis capabilities and real-time demand commitments, considering constraints. Typical modules include:

• Available/capable to promise
• Sales and operations planning/integrated business planning
• Collaborative planning (including forecasting and replenishment)
• Vendor-managed inventory/direct point of sale
• Event planning (promotion, life cycle)
• Demand planning
• Inventory planning
• Production/factory planning and scheduling
• Distribution planning (unconstrained, distribution requirements planning [DRP] and deployment)
• Strategic network design
• Inventory strategy optimization (simultaneous, multitiered)
• Supply planning (optimized, DRP and deployment)

$SDH

This is one of the named indexes belonging to $Secure.

See also: Index, $SII and $Secure.

SDH/SONET

SDH/SONET technology differs by region. SONET is sold only in North America. SDH is sold outside North America and comes in two types: SDH (Japan) is sold only in Japan, while SDH (ETSI) is sold in the rest of the world. SDH/SONET supports ring and mesh topologies, and protection of circuits through automatic protection switching (APS) is standard, via various protection programs.

SDH/SONET comes in standardized bit rates, with SDH circuits referred to as synchronous transfer mode (STM)-x (where x = 1, 4, 16, 64 and 256) connections and SONET circuits known as Optical Carrier Rate (OC)-n (where n = 3, 12, 48, 192, 768) connections. The standardized bit rates are:

• STM-1/OC-3 (155 Mbps).
• STM-4/OC-12 (622 Mbps).
• STM-16/OC-48 (2.5 Gbps).
• STM-64/OC-192 (10 Gbps).
• STM-256/OC-768 (40 Gbps).

Originally, the SDH/SONET standards were defined as a rigid hierarchy optimized specifically to handle circuit-based voice traffic. With the requirement to support data services becoming more evident, additions were made to the SDH/SONET standards to allow for more flexible traffic handling, especially with regard to data services in general and Ethernet services in particular. New features such as the Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) and LCAS were added to the standards, as well as support for increased control plane functionality as defined in the standards for Automatic Switched Transport Network (ASTN)/Automatic Switched Optical Network (ASON).

In addition, vendors have added cross-connect functionality to SDH/SONET equipment to support add/drop functionality. Also, convergence between SDH/SONET and WDM products has become the norm in the optical transport market.

SDK (software development kit)

A set of development utilities for writing software applications, usually associated with specific environments (e.g., the Windows SDK).

SDMA (spatial division multiple access)

Advanced multiple antenna technique that increases the spectral efficiency, range and bandwidth available to moving wireless devices. Traditional cellular base stations radiate power in all directions, because they have no information about where the mobile device is located. This wastes power and causes interference to adjacent cells, as well as making it harder to distinguish weaker incoming signals from among the noise and interference. By using smart antenna technology to track the spatial location of mobile devices, the radiation pattern of the base station can be adjusted to optimize both transmission and reception for each user device. By rapidly adjusting the phase of signals from several antennas, the base station can effectively steer a beam or a spot of RF power to or from each user. Unlike MIMO, only one antenna is required at the client device, potentially reducing customer premises equipment (CPE) costs. SDMA techniques are used in proprietary wireless broadband systems, such as Navini Networks’ Ripwave and ArrayComm’s iBurst, and are likely options for mobile WiMAX and LTE. See also smart antenna.

SDR (software-defined radio)

Radio hardware and software design that can tune to any frequency across a wide range of spectrum and can decode any modulation technique or protocol – all under software control. SDRs are complex and expensive to build and have mainly been used for military applications until recently, but have now been introduced into cellular base stations. The low cost and increasing power of modern digital signal processors, as well as the huge and growing market for multiband, multimode mobile phones, will make consumer SDR devices practical and economically feasible by 2010. For example, to support global roaming and today’s feature set, a mobile phone requires six frequency bands (800MHz, 900MHz, 1,800MHz, 1,900MHz, 2.1GHz and 2.4GHz) and at least three protocol families – GSM/GPRS/EDGE/WCDMA, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. By 2010, support will likely require two more bands (2.3GHz and 3.5GHz) and two more protocols – LTE and WiMAX.

secondary station

On a communications pathway, a terminal device that has been selected to operate under the control of another terminal device.

secondhand market

Previously owned or used mobile devices that are sold or given free to other users who typically obtain a new network connection. Secondhand devices sometimes are refurbished systematically before resale in other countries or passed on to other users in their original condition. Although most countries have a small secondhand market, it is a significant factor in price-sensitive developing markets such as China, where marginal subscribers are looking for the lowest-cost, entry-level device.

secret key

The symmetric key used in secret-key cryptography. It is a secret shared between communicating parties, but is not truly private. See secret-key cryptography, private key and public-key cryptography.

secret-key cryptography

In this cryptography method (also known as symmetric-key cryptography), the single key needed to encrypt and decrypt messages is a shared secret between the communicating parties. The biggest problem with this method is that the secret key must be communicated through an external mechanism separate from the communication channel over which the encrypted text flows. In addition, secret-key systems do not support digital signatures. These limitations are addressed in public-key cryptography (see separate entry).

Sector

Unit of data on the physical storage unit. The storage controller can only access data in multiples of this unit. A sector is usually 512 bytes, but can be 1 KB on certain Asian hard disks.

$Secure

This metadata file stores a table of security descriptors used by the volume.

secure web gateway

Secure Web gateway solutions protect Web-surfing PCs from infection and enforce company policies. A secure Web gateway is a solution that filters unwanted software/malware from user-initiated Web/Internet traffic and enforces corporate and regulatory policy compliance. These gateways must, at a minimum, include URL filtering, malicious-code detection and filtering, and application controls for popular Web-based applications, such as instant messaging (IM) and Skype. Native or integrated data leak prevention is also increasingly included.

Security

There are two levels of security in NTFS. There are the DOS File Permissions, such as Read Only and Hidden and an ACL model which grants specific permissions to specific users.

See also: ACE, ACL, Permissions, $SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR and SID.

Sequence Array (See Update Sequence)

seiban

Japanese management practice of numbering all aspects of manufacturing.

selective sourcing

Selective sourcing is when an internal IT organization decouples or carves up the scope of business or IT processes for purposes of individually or selectively sourcing each component separately and distinctly. The main business driver is to determine the best risk/reward combination for each individual scope of work. Most often, this is done to allow for extensive competition to achieve the highest-quality performance at the best price point. The overall role of overseeing (program management) and managing the delivery, risk and overall legal compliance across the entire scope of services across all the individual components lies with the internal IT organization.

selector

The last octet of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) address.

self-describing messages

A message that contains data as well as the metadata that describes the format and the meaning (i.e., the syntax and the semantics) of that data. For example, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a self-describing message format that consists of tag/value pairs.

A group of instructions capable of assigning blocks of memory as they are needed.

self-service business intelligence

Self-service business intelligence is defined here as end users designing and deploying their own reports and analyses within an approved and supported architecture and tools portfolio.

self-test and fault isolation

Most systems include a processor-check capability that allows the controlling computer to test itself and the rest of the system. If a fault is found, an alarm light is lit and a message is given on the system printer teletype, if one is provided. This feature also expedites service since the computer can pinpoint faulty equipment, saving diagnostic time.

sell side

Processes for companies to sell their products, including catalogs, transaction processors, payment processors, and supply chain management methods and tools.

semantic data model

A method of organizing data that reflects the basic meaning of data items and the relationships among them. This organization makes it easier to develop application programs and to maintain the consistency of data when it is updated.

Semantic nets

semi-mobile wireless

Includes client device support for roaming among base station coverage areas at pedestrian speeds. At a minimum, the client mobile device is transportable to secondary fixed locations with no connection while in transit. The terms “nomadic” and “portable,” in use by the WiMAX Forum, fit into this category. The terms “nomadic,” “portable” and “mobile” often vary in definition when used by vendors. See also fixed wireless and mobile wireless.

sensei (also lean sensei)

A master teacher of lean techniques. Similar in experience to a Black Belt or Master Black Belt in the Six Sigma methodology but more focused on facilitation and teaching than on actual practice.

sensor and RFID-based inventory and asset management business process application software

Innovative business models and processes will be the main way that RFID begins to be justified. But enterprises don’t have many applications to manage these processes today. For example, real-time management of inventory in a retail environment is almost unheard of today, and retailers will need entirely new applications to deal with it. Vendors providing these solutions are fragmented, and each solution will probably emerge as a separate market.

sensor and RFID-based inventory and asset management infrastructure software

Enterprises need software and development patterns to deal with RFID data and hardware. Currently, the most popular approach is to put in middleware that acts like an integration broker between RFID readers and business applications that need to receive the data.

serial dot matrix

An output device that creates a character image by selectively placing individual dots on the substrate using mechanical force. These include the following:

• 9 pin – Devices with 9-wire print heads
• 18 pin – Devices with 18-wire print heads
• 24 pin – Devices with 24-wire print heads

serial inkjet

An output device that creates the desired image by emitting ink from an array of orifices or nozzles. The array of nozzles shuttles across the page, printing one character at a time, or serially. This category includes the following types of device:

• Piezo electric inkjet – Print heads in which ink is ejected by electrically actuating a special crystalline or ceramic component to compress the ink and force it out of the nozzle.
• Thermal inkjet – Heat is used to generate vapor bubbles, which are ejected through nozzles that project droplets onto a surface to form text or images. Thermal inkjet’s advantages include small and highly controlled droplets and high system reliability. Thermal inkjet print heads are used in a wide range of serial and line inkjets. Originally developed for desktop printers, thermal inkjet printing has spread to specialty applications, such as direct-mail addressing, wide-format printing and package coding operations.

serial interface

A processor that provides a specific service to systems on a network. Routing servers connect subnetworks of like architecture; gateway servers connect networks of different architectures by performing protocol conversions; and terminal, printer and file servers provide interfaces between peripheral devices and systems on the network.

server appliance

A type of computing appliance that creates, manipulates or provides information to other network-connected computing devices. Unlike storage appliances, server appliances use an application context for the creation, manipulation or provision of information.

serverless printing

Serverless printing is peer-to-peer printing over Internet Protocol. This permits the removal of a dedicated print server for managing print queues, distributing printer drivers, and so on.

server virtualization infrastructure

Server virtualization infrastructure includes the hypervisor, VM and virtual machine monitors (VMMs). The key to “virtualizing” a server is the hypervisor. A hypervisor is a layer of software (the term “software” can mean preloaded software that runs in a protected area or microcode/firmware, depending on the implementation) that runs directly on hardware and allows the definition of fixed partitions with predefined priorities for accessing hardware resources. These partitions are incomplete VMs because they prioritize, but do not share, all hardware resources. To support flexible configuration, a hypervisor in general is implemented with a VMM. The VMM virtualizes all hardware needed for VMs to run. Most products currently labeled hypervisors bundle a VMM.

server virtualization management

Server virtualization management tools comprise management tools embedded in the hypervisor sale, as well as operations management and administration management tools. Server virtualization management technology can be found in two types of delivery vehicles. The first is embedded within the infrastructure itself – in this case, as part of the package that includes the hypervisor (companies such as VMware have historically referred to this as “virtual infrastructure”).

More manageability is seen built into infrastructure components because they provide technology suppliers with an additional source of revenue and a basis for competitive differentiation of their core technologies. Management technology can also be sourced from third-party independent software vendors, as well as emerging firms with only a virtualization-oriented lineage. In addition, hypervisor vendors are providing additional management tooling on top of that already provided within their virtualization platforms in areas such as administrative consoles, capacity planning, and process and workflow automation.

service bureau

A company that processes various types of data for a client for a fee. Station message detail reporting (SMDR) and call-costing reports are typically provided.

service desk

A help desk that is equipped with the resources for resolving service requests and problem calls. It gives the customer service representative or end user the ability to efficiently diagnose, troubleshoot and correct technical-support problems, rather than being a “pass through.”

serving area

The geographic area handled by a telephone exchange, generally equivalent to a local access and transport area (LATA).

servlet

A form of server-based Java that operates in conjunction with a Web server and offers an alternative to using Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and server application programming interfaces (SAPIs) to communicate with Web server processes. In addition, servlets are independent of a given type of Web server, as the most prominent Web servers support servlets.

service provider routers and switches

Routers are a class of network controller that determines the best route for data and voice transmissions between a transmitter (sender) and a receiver. They are typically controlled by software and can be programmed to provide the most inexpensive, fastest or least-busy routes available. Routers operate at Layer 3 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. This definition applies to service provider routers only.

session border controllers

SBCs connect IP networks (enterprise to service provider) and introduce new edge requirements in three major areas: security, service assurance and law enforcement. SBCs sit at the edge of the service provider’s network and complement established routers with their ability to perform required control functions by integrating session signaling and media control. SBCs operate as SIP back-to-back user agents, MGCP proxy/network-address translations (NATs) and/or H.323 back-to-back gateways. They are both the source and the destination of all signaling messages and media streams entering and leaving the provider’s network.

Vendors and products in this category include:

• Acme Packet: Net-Net Session Director.
• AudioCodes: nCite 1000, nCite 4000 session border controllers.
• Ditech Networks: PeerPoint Session Border Controller.
• Genband: Multiprotocol Session Controllers.
• Quintum Technologies: Tenor Call Relay Session Border Controllers.

The SBC space has been largely cornered by startup vendors, but other equipment vendors have taken two approaches: they have partnered with the SBC vendors or embedded SBC functionality into some of their existing solutions, such as routers. There are some embedded solutions with SBC function, but counts only those that are stand-alone. Vendors such as Cisco and Sonus Networks have integrated SBCs into their routing and switching platforms.

seven wastes

A framework of seven types of activity that do not add value; originally defined by Toyota: overproducing – producing product before there’s a valid order; unnecessary waiting – lengthened cycle time, which reduces agility; unnecessary transportation – unnecessary transportation of material between sites; overprocessing – processes longer or more complex than necessary; unnecessary inventory – buildup of work-in-process or raw materials; unnecessary movement – inefficient workplace; layout causing extra work; and too many defects – poor process quality and too much rework. This list was extended to include an eighth waste: asset underutilization or other underutilization of resources. The eight wastes are often referred to by the acronym “DOWNTIME,” meaning “Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Nonutilized resources, Transportation, Inventory, Motion and Excessive processing.”

Direct sales software builds on the attributes of technology, functionality and value of order management systems and also includes the functionality for sales execution and sales operations. The direct B2B sales organization is the traditional sales channel, composed of internal sales resources focused on the selling of products or services directly into the client, customer and prospect base as employees of the provider company. Direct sales resources may be field-based, calling on customers face to face at their locations, or inside sales, selling from a desk environment over the phone.

SFC (shop floor control)

A system of computers and/or controllers tools used to schedule, dispatch and track the progress of work orders through manufacturing based on defined routings. SFCs typically calculate work in process based on a percentage of completion for each order and operation that are useful in inventory valuations and materials planning.

A system-level facility to enable shadowing or mirroring (i.e., duplication) of selected databases to a separate disk or disk set. The purpose is to minimize the space required for backup data while providing for the continuation of critical processing in the event of the loss of a disk containing related databases.

shared services

“Shared services” is a delivery model in which a shared-service center, supported by dedicated people, processes and technologies, acts as a centralized provider of a defined business function for use by multiple enterprise constituencies. The service center may be physical, virtual or logical. The enterprise constituencies that use the services must either govern the services or be well-represented in the decision-making body. Shared services typically involve standardizing and streamlining data, processes, and infrastructure, as well as implementing financial disciplines around the services being delivered, regardless of whether they are delivered internally, by external service providers or by a combination of the two.shell.

A term used to refer to packaged software applications (from the shrink-wrapped packaging typical of such products).
Term initially used to describe an unsigned software license agreement that is deemed accepted when the user breaks a shrink-wrapped seal or opens an enclosed sealed envelope in the package containing the software media, such as a floppy disk or CD. Use of the term has been expanded to refer to software license agreements that are accepted electronically. See click-wrapped.

S-HTTP (Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol)

Also known as HTTPS, this is an extension of Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) that provides security services for transaction confidentiality, authenticity and integrity between HTTP servers and clients. For the purposes of Internet browsers, S-HTTP is a competitive alternative to the more widely used Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) standard. S-HTTP was designed for use in browser applications, so it cannot be used to secure non-browser-based Internet applications.

SI (systems integrator)

signal-to noise ratio

Measurement of the quality of the wireless signal that is expressed as the ratio between the power of the transmitting signal and the noise that is present trying to corrupt that signal.

signature

Any mark or symbol accepted by both parties to show intent, approval of, or responsibility for, a document. In e-business, for example, a “from” line on an e-mail, a mouse click of acceptance of terms, an e-mail closing, a biometric and electronic signatures of several types are accepted as signatures. Some laws specify a written signature to be legally acceptable. New laws give the same status to electronic signatures as written signatures.

signature verification

A biometric technique that uses characteristics of a person’s signature (including pressure, pen lifts, speed and direction of pen strokes) to authenticate identity. Signature is less accurate than some other biometrics (e.g., fingerprints, iris) but is popular in document authentication applications that have traditionally used written signatures. Some growth may be fueled by the adoption of pen-based devices (e.g., the Palm Pilot) that can double as a signature input tablet.

Members of the SIO should have in-depth knowledge of, and experience in, both business and technology, with at least one representative from senior management.

SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)

Text-based protocol, similar to HTTP and SMTP, for initiating interactive communication sessions among users for voice and data communications.

SITE (strategy, iteration, testing, enablement)

Information systems (IS) departments have a history in applications development of following a design process of planning, prototyping, testing and development, resulting in justifiable design decisions. SITE is a concept that seeks to build on this long-established IS department practice by creating a structured framework within which both business unit (BU) managers and IS staff see clearly identified roles maximize their talents and skills. As a result, issues such as staffing, success factors, return on investment (ROI) guidelines, request for proposals (RFPs), interface design and graphic design are addressed in an environment where decisions are not arbitrary. Whether final execution is in-house or outsourced, adhering to SITE principles provides a project blueprint meaningful to multiple audiences.

Six Sigma

Six Sigma is a business management strategy aimed at improving the quality of process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability. “Six Sigma” refers to a six standard deviation distance between a process norm and its nearest specification limit; in practice, Six Sigma is also known by its improvement process steps: “Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control” (DMAIC).

skill mining

A knowledge management (KM) functionality that automatically identifies the skills of knowledge workers by analyzing past behavior. This behavior may be implicit (e.g., looking for recurring concepts in documents that the worker has produced), or explicit (e.g., a worker’s willingness and ability to answer a question in the past). Skill mining enables users to identify who in their enterprise has the expertise to address specific questions or problems.

SKU (stock-keeping unit)

SMA (service management agreement)

A tool for monitoring, measuring, managing and demonstrating the contribution of IT to the enterprise.

smart antenna

Also known as adaptive antennas, these use an array of antennas in combination with smart signal processing algorithms that track the location of a mobile client device using techniques such as the direction of arrival of a signal. The location or angular direction is then used to calculate beam-forming vectors to focus more of the power of the antenna beam on the mobile target. Smart antennas are used in cellular mobile phone systems and in proposed wireless broadband technologies such as 802.16e-2005 (WiMAX) and 802.11n (MIMO). See also SDMA.

smart card

A plastic card that contains a microprocessor and a memory chip or just a memory chip. The microprocessor card has the ability to add, delete and manipulate information on the card. A memory-chip card, such as a phone card, can only add information. By maintaining all necessary functions and information on the card, smart cards do not require access to remote databases. Growing interest in smart cards crosses barriers of geography, industry and business functions. However, the variety of smart card applications belies the fact that smart cards are capable of only three functions:

Information Storage and Management: Storing data off-line is an important feature of the smart card. It can maintain, for example, all of an individual’s health-related information. Data can be stored and updated continuously either in a write-once format (e.g., a patient’s blood type or known allergies) or in a read/write memory (e.g., a patient’s last visit to the doctor). Memory can store information that does not change, build a history of transactions, or maintain a current data value (as in a phone card). The ability to add and subtract data value from the card makes it particularly useful in financial transactions that use electronic cash or credit and debit. The basic technique is the same whether it is applied to monetary values or frequent-flyer miles. Because the records are always in the user’s possession, privacy is enhanced since duplicate information may be stored at a secure, off-line site in case the card is lost or damaged.
Authentication: Smart cards can manipulate the data they contain to enable real-time transactions. Authentication is the process that determines whether the card will allow a transaction.
Encryption/Decryption: Encryption changes data into a form that can be read only by the intended receiver. To decipher the message, the receiver of the encrypted data must have the proper decryption key. By its very nature, data encryption and decryption must take place in a local, secure environment. The capability of smart cards to perform this function within the embedded chip means that secure data does not have to be transferred from the card to a reader or other device. This reduces the chance that information can be stolen from the card.

smart grid

The smart grid is a vision of the future electricity delivery infrastructure that improves network efficiency and resilience, while empowering consumers and addressing energy sustainability concerns.

smartphone

Mobile communications device that uses an identifiable open OS. An open OS is supported by third-party applications written by a notable developer community. Examples are Symbian, Linux (including Android), Windows Mobile, RIM and Apple iPhone OS. Third-party applications can be installed and removed, and they can be created for the device’s OS and application programming interfaces (APIs). Alternatively, developers must be able to access APIs through a discrete layer such as Java. The OS must support a multitasking environment and user interface that can handle multiple applications simultaneously. For example, it can display e-mail while playing music.

smart terminal

A display terminal that can operate in either conversational or block mode and can support a full range of local editing capabilities.

SMBs (small and midsize businesses)

Businesses which, due to their size, have different IT requirements – and often face different IT challenges – than large enterprises, and whose IT resources (usually budget and staff) are often highly constrained. For the purposes of its research, SMBs is defined using the following approximate size categories:

• Small business: In the United States, less than $50 million in annual revenue and up to 100 employees; in Europe, less than $10 million in annual revenue and up to 75 employees
• Midsize business: In the United States, between $50 million and $300 million in annual revenue and between 100 and 1,000 employees; in Europe, between $10 million and $150 million in annual revenue and between 75 and 300 employees

A wireless communications technology in competition with analog cellular services. In an SMR system, the base station equipment supplier is the licensee of the transmitters. Users have access to the multiple channels of the network rather than the limited number of channels of a private mobile radio network. Many users share all of the available channels. Sharing is accomplished on a first-come, first-served basis. When users want to initiate a call, they activate the push-to-talk button on the handset. Assuming the portable unit (and dispatcher or other portable unit) is tuned to an available channel, a communication path is established. If channels that the sender and receiver can use are not available, the call cannot be completed, and the operator must wait for another opportunity to try again.

SMS (short message service)

Facility developed as part of the GSM standard that enables a mobile device to send, receive and display messages of up to 160 characters in Roman text and variations for non-Roman character sets. Messages received are stored in the network if the subscriber device is inactive and are relayed when it becomes active. SMS has become available increasingly in CDMA networks and in some fixed networks.

SMS (system-managed storage)

The term used for the conceptualization of an architecture for attachment, management and reconfiguration of secondary storage. Among the SMS basic design goals is the separation of logical-device management from physical-device management.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

A messaging protocol governing electronic-mail transmission in Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networks. It is used to transfer e-mail between computers. It is a server-to-server protocol. SMTP supports only text and cannot handle attachments. It supports negative delivery notifications, not the positive notifications required by electronic data interchange (EDI).

sniffer

A network management tool that monitors data packets on a network to help administrators ensure message integrity and service quality.

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

A Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)-derived protocol governing network management and the monitoring of network devices. Strictly speaking, SNMP is the Management Information Base (MIB) described in the SNMP standard; extensions to this MIB proposed by the Electronic Messaging Association permit the monitoring and reporting of all conforming messaging components through standard SNMP management tools for network components.

SNOMED (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine)

A nomenclature created by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) for use in pathology. SNOMED has gradually been extended to cover other domains of medicine. It contains over 150,000 items and includes coverage for numerous medical specialties. CAP is also developing SNOMED RT for reference terminology and SNOMED CT for combined terminology.

SOA (service-oriented architecture)

Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the dominant architectural style for agile business applications, and is used when enterprises anticipate application sharing and frequent system changes. SOA helps business managers and analysts develop new business processes, and modify processes more quickly and at a lower cost…

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

A protocol introduced by Microsoft in conjunction with some small vendors. Designed to be simple, it creates transparent mapping of the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) interface definition language (IDL) and the Extensible Markup Language (XML) definitions. It provides the key technology for transport in the next-generation Internet as a set of e-services.

SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan)

A process used by clinicians to identify and assess a patient’s health status, and the subsequent treatments or course of therapy to improve this status.

SOC (software oversight committee)

A healthcare committee charged with ensuring that patients are not placed at risk by implemented software solutions. SOCs contain representative from all aspects of the healthcare enterprise. It has been suggested that SOCs be formed along the lines of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations’ (JCAHO’s) institutional review boards (IRBs). IRBs typically are composed of risk management lawyers, medical ethicists, physicians and other interested parties within the care delivery organization (CDO).

Because of the technical nature of the task, an SOC must have information systems (IS) representation. An SOC should meet on a regular basis to review all current and planned medical software implementations. In addition, it should form, and possibly enforce, a policy designed to ensure patient safety where medical software is concerned.

Specific SOC responsibilities include validating that applications perform reliably and as expected, for example, by creating and running trial scenarios looking at both system and clinical functionality. A SOC should ensure that all decision support applications are based on accurate data, that they are implemented correctly and that the rule base is kept current. It should also examine how the various packages operate in tandem, paying close attention to combinations of functions that could potentially lead to errors that place patients at risk.

social BPM

“Social BPM” is a concept that describes collaboratively designed and iterated processes. These processes mirror the way work is performed from a “doer” perspective and experienced from a “receiver” perspective to harness the power of continuous learning from “the collective.”

social CRM

Social CRM is “a business strategy that entails the extension of marketing, sales and customer service processes to include the active participation of customers or visitors to an Internet channel (Web or mobile) with the goal of fostering participation in the business process.”

social media

An online environment where content is created, consumed, promoted, distributed, discovered or shared for purposes which are primarily related to communities and social activities rather than functional, task-oriented objectives. “Media” in this context is an environment characterized by storage and transmission, while “social” describes the distinct way that these messages propagate in a one-to-many or many-to-many fashion. A distinction is drawn in this definition between media (the enabling environment) and content (what the environment contains).

social software

“Social software” is the tools that encourage, capture, and organize open and free-form interaction between employees, customers, and partners. It is a “socializing” technology – sometimes also referred to as Enterprise 2.0 – that enables a grassroots approach to creating and exploiting collective knowledge.

sockets

The Berkeley interprocess communications model. A socket specifies the end points of a two-way communications channel which connects two processes together so they can exchange information.

softswitch architecture

Softswitch architecture comprises softswitches/MGCs, VoIP gateways and application servers. These are among the terms used to identify the major network elements of softswitch architecture. For our purposes, the terms “softswitch” and “softswitch architecture” refer to the softswitch/VoIP gateway/application server approach to distributed switching technology.

Softswitches for cable networks are essentially the same as those used by traditional telephone companies, but they must comply with the NG standards from Cable Television Laboratories (CableLabs) for packetized voice-over-cable networks.

Softswitch architectures are mostly being deployed in traditional operators’ core networks for wireline or mobile trunking, and in the networks of long-distance service providers. Many voice-over-broadband networks are based on Class 5 architecture to provision Class 5 services, as well as calling card services using VoIP technology. In mobile networks, deployment of mobile softswitches in the radio access network (RAN) is limited by the slow deployment of third-generation (3G) infrastructure and the highly optimized TDM architecture in the RAN.

With the migration to SIP, softswitch architecture lends itself to the 3GPP and ETSI TISPAN standards to develop IMS-compliant applications.

softswitches

To provide services without a physical switch, a softswitch is connected to a server (a Sun Microsystems or Unix machine, for instance) that runs the application. A softswitch is also connected to a media gateway, which is the element that physically connects to the PSTN, IP network or ATM network.

A softswitch is also known as a call agent, a call server or an MGC. It is a device that provides the traditional call control functions or switching matrix of a Class 4 and Class 5 switch. In a mobile network, a softswitch is also called a mobile switching center (MSC). At minimum, a softswitch provides:

• Intelligence that controls connection services for a media gateway or native IP endpoint.
• The ability to select processes that can be applied to a call.
• Routing for a call in the network, based on signaling and customer database information.
• The ability to transfer control of a call to another network element.
• Interfaces to, and support for, management functions, such as provisioning fault-tolerant billing.
• Support for multiple protocols, including some subsets of MGCP, Media Gateway Control Protocol (Megaco), SIP, SS7, call processing language, H.323 and Q.931/Q.2931.
• DiffServ, Resource Reservation Protocol, Real-Time Transport Protocol, Real-Time Control Protocol, MPLS and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11p.
• Compliance/interoperation with some subsets of standards from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Frame Relay Forum, ATM Forum, IEEE’s IMS Forum and 3GPP/3GPP2.

software as a service (SaaS)

SaaS (software as a service) is software that’s owned, delivered and managed remotely by one or more providers. If the vendor requires user organizations to install software on-premises using their infrastructure, then the application isn’t SaaS.

software development

Project management, specifications, design, programming, testing, installation and training associated with a specific application development project of any size.

software maintenance

Updating software, adding new functions, fixing bugs and solving problems. Technology vendors often sell a maintenance contract with their software. This contract is usually calculated as an annual fee based on some percentage of the total software cost. It generally provides for overall support and maintenance of a software product, including applications. Support may include telephone assistance time as well.

software support services

Software support services are generally technical support or break/fix services that are delivered for specific software products. These services include revenue derived from long-term technical-support contracts or pay-as-you-go, incident-based support. Software support services typically include remote troubleshooting capabilities, installation assistance and basic usability assistance. Remote troubleshooting capabilities may be delivered via telephone and online communication media or without human assistance through automated means that reside on the customer’s device or are available on the Web.

Software support services may include new product installation services, installation of product updates, migrations for major releases of software, other types of proactive or reactive on-site services, and support for custom application or infrastructure software. Services may be delivered by a product vendor, a consulting firm or third-party software maintainers.

Software products and technologies covered under this category include commercial and custom operating systems, application software, and infrastructure software. Software support services do not include software license code updates and upgrades, which vendors often report as software maintenance.

The segments covered in software support map directly to market segments covered in software market statistics.

SOHO (small office/home office)

A market segment for office equipment or computing peripherals (e.g., printers or copiers). Products targeted to the SOHO market tend to be lower in price and functionality than those designed to support large, corporate office environments.

spectrum harmonization

A global effort under the auspices of the ITU to encourage governments and regulators to allocate RF spectrum consistently across borders, thereby enabling global roaming, interoperability and global markets for telecom equipment. Every four years, the ITU holds the World Radiocommunication Conference, where global/regional spectrum assignments are negotiated and agreed. A recent example is the 1.9GHz to 2.1GHz band, which has been allocated to UMTS in almost every geography. The WiMAX Forum is undertaking similar efforts to support global allocation of 2.5GHz and 3.5GHz for wireless broadband.

speech circuit

A circuit designed for the transmission of speech, either analog or encoded, but which can also be used for data transmission or telegraphy.

speech recognition

A computer’s ability to convert spoken input to text. Special software takes vocal sounds, digitizes them and then compares them to a library of sound patterns. When matches are found, the computer can use those words just as if they had been typed on a keyboard. Speech recognition can improve personal productivity in the workplace, increase the effectiveness of interactive voice response (IVR) systems, and bring computing to untraditional environments (e.g., a hospital emergency room). The term “voice recognition” is also commonly used to refer to the ability of a machine or program to recognize and carry out voice commands or take dictation.

Speech recognition software generally falls into three categories along a continuum:

• Command systems were the earliest and simplest form; the computer learns a small number of voice commands like “open file” or “print document,” freeing the user from having to use a keyboard or mouse to perform those tasks.
• Discrete speech recognition, the second stage in this evolution, can be used for dictation and other natural speaking conditions, but pauses are required between words.
• Continuous speech recognition software is emerging today. These systems understand natural speech without pauses, and their vocabularies and accuracy will continue to expand and improve.

SPF (Shortest Path First)

spider

A piece of software (also called a Web crawler) designed to follow hyperlinks to their completion, and return information on Internet addresses passed.

spoofing

A process whereby a router responds to keep alive messages from a host rather than passing them on the remote client, thus saving call charges. Used mainly in Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).
Of a packet, falsely claiming to be from an address different from that from which it actually originated.

spot beam

An antenna radiation pattern designed to focus on or serve a relatively small or isolated geographic area, usually with high gain or power. A spot beam is the RF equivalent of a spotlight. Many next-generation satellite designs, including newer, high-capacity Ka-band satellites, have spot beam technology that can be activated to direct service to key markets where demand is highest. When combined with frequency reuse capabilities, DVB-S2 and MPEG-4 advanced compression technology, spot beams can significantly boost an operator’s satellite capacity more than older Ku-band, MPEG-2, DVB-S satellite systems. See also DVB-S2, frequency reuse, Ka-band and Ku-band.

SPP (service parts planning)

Service parts planning (SPP) supports the optimal stock quantities and location of items used to service internal assets or customer equipment in the aftermarket. SPP applications address processes such as:

• Forecasting and demand planning
• Inventory planning and optimization
• Distribution/allocation and supply planning
• Collaboration
• Workforce planning
• Analytics and BAM (such as visibility and event management)
• Pricing optimization
• Returns and repair center management

spread spectrum

Radio technology that enables a number of radio communication links to use the same band of frequencies simultaneously without mutual interference.

SQL (Structured Query Language)

A relational data language that provides a consistent, English keyword-oriented set of facilities for query, data definition, data manipulation and data control. It is a programmed interface to relational database management systems (RDBMSs). IBM introduced SQL as the main external interface to its experimental RDBMS, System R, which it developed in the 1970s. SQL statements include:

• Data manipulation language statements: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE
• Data definition language statements, including the CREATE and DROP statements for tables and indexes
• Statements that control data consistency, and grant and revoke authority

SQL statements are called “dynamic” when they are not completely specified until the program is executed. They are called “static” when they are completely specified when the program is compiled. SQL is precise, because it is based on predicate logic, but is difficult for average users to deal with, and its most fruitful position is as a protocol for software-to-software connectivity, rather than for human-to-software access.

SRM (storage resource management)

Storage resource management (SRM) products provide data collection and automation agents that consolidate and operate on information from multiple platforms supporting storage management tools on multiple OSs, storage devices and storage area network (SAN) devices. Key functions include capacity reporting and analysis, performance reporting and analysis, capacity and performance management automation, resource availability, storage provisioning, storage management product integration, application and database integration, and hardware integration. Basic network and system management (NSM) integration should provide the ability of the SRM product to externalize events to other management products. Product-specific integration includes the ability to launch the SRM product from the NSM console. Integration with device resource management products and media management products should include launch of hardware configuration utilities from the SRM console, collection and reporting of agent information, and integration of logical-level data. Typical SRM tools require a SAN management tool to manage and collect data from heterogeneous devices on the SAN. Stand-alone SAN management tools are also included in the SRM segment. Products that provide for discovery, topology mapping and monitoring of SAN components are also included in this segment because many are being included with SRM suites or are expanding to include SRM functionality. SRM tools may offer real-time or historical views into one or several of the physical, volume/virtual, file or database levels, and/or point and time copy views.

SSB (single sideband)

To make efficient use of the frequency band available, the carrier and the unwanted sideband of an amplitude-modulated wave can be filtered out so that only the sideband that contains all the information is transmitted. This is known as SSB transmission.

SSP (storage service provider)

A company that provides computer storage capacity and management services. In addition to the storage itself, SSPs typically offer periodic backup and archiving, and some offer to consolidate data from multiple enterprise locations so that all locations can share the data effectively.

SSPC (structure, scripting, populating and channel outputs)

A framework for creating documents that requires four core mechanisms for defining the structure, scripting, populating (filling) and output channels of documents.

Structure definition consists of tools to define components (e.g., title, author, introduction, conclusion) and their sequence (e.g., “introductions” precede “conclusions”). The defined sequence cannot be modified or removed through editing.
Scripting is procedural logic that defines how to derive (i.e., calculate) content, and how to access or create queries that test and conditionally incorporate content from external sources (e.g., databases), other applications and content repositories.
Populating executes scripts against the structural definition to create an instance of the content model expressed in the document definition. This includes executing data and content retrieval, queries and computations to generate a fleshed-out document (an “instance”) from the document skeleton defined by the structural and scripting elements.
Output channels control the content so that the same content can be formatted and composed for multiple media, such as print, Web or CD-ROM delivery.

Revenue is for new license sales and for maintenance and support services that include new version license sales to update an existing license to a new version, telephone support and on-site remedial support. Revenue does not include professional services. For products to be included in this coverage, they must represent a revenue stream for the company that is separately tracked and not be only part of a bundled product or service.

Storage management software coverage spans from the desktop to the mainframe and includes products that focus on a single or limited set of devices, as well as those products that support a heterogeneous set of devices.

The storage management software market is divided into seven segments. Storage management software is the sum of all the segments and represents all the tools needed to manage capacity, performance and availability of data stored on disks, tapes and optical devices, as well as the networking devices that the data may pass through.

storage subsystem hardware services

This segment includes other storage subsystem services and redundant array of independent disks (RAID)-based storage system services.

• RAID-based storage system services – This category includes the total of all external controller-based RAID-based disk storage, host-based external RAID storage, host-based internal RAID storage and network-attached storage. RAID refers to a set of disk drives (at least two) with input/output activity that is managed by external-based or host-based RAID technology.
• Other storage subsystem services – This category includes tape libraries, optical libraries and hard-disk drive upgrades/replacements.

storage support services

Stream

All data on NTFS is stored in streams, which can have names. A file can have more than one data streams, but exactly one must have no name. The size of a file is the size of its unnamed data attribute.

streaming

Technique that supports the continuous, one-way transmission of audio and/or video data via the Internet and, more recently, via a mobile network. In contrast to audio (for example, MP3) and movie (for example, MPEG) files that must first be downloaded, streaming media begins playing within a few seconds of the request. Streaming requires a streaming encoder (which converts the audio or video source to a data stream), a streaming server that delivers the encoded media over a network, and a client media player that cooperates with the server to deliver uninterrupted media. To compensate for variations in network quality and latency, the client buffers a few seconds of audio or video before beginning delivery, then tries to stay ahead during playback. Examples of streaming systems include Windows Media, QuickTime and RealPlayer.

sub-11GHz proprietary BWA

Sub-11GHz proprietary broadband wireless access (BWA) systems are not WiMAX-certified or designed for IEEE 802.16. They include technologies such as IPWireless, Flarion and iBurst. In most cases, they are deployed to provide service providers with quick and easy access to business subscribers or to allow the delivery of broadband data services or fast Internet access to business and residential subscribers. In addition, these systems enable cost-effective network access in remote rural areas. Sub-11GHz proprietary BWA systems provide more than 1 Mbps per subscriber.

The Supranet is enabled by four key phenomena:

• Embedded computers in many everyday objects
• Next-generation wireless networking, providing global indoor and outdoor connectivity to the Internet
• Interfacing technologies that enable bidirectional communication between p-world and e-world components (e.g., bar code scanning, speech recognition and electronic identification)
• The design of applications that satisfy user needs in a natural way with combinations of media and devices

SVGA (Super Video Graphics Array)

A Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) display standard that provides higher resolution than the 640 x 480 Video Graphics Array (VGA) standard. It can support as many as 16 million colors, depending on the computer system and amount of available memory.

SWAP (Simple Workflow Access Protocol)

An Internet-based protocol designed to provide a Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)-based way to access a generic workflow service or a workflow enabled process or to interoperate with it. SWAP, which has been endorsed by the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC), will offer a set of standard definitions for the type and structure of messages passed between cooperating workflow systems. SWAP will allow a workflow system to start, monitor, exchange data with and control workflow instances on a different workflow system. It will also provide a way to integrate workflow systems with other Web-based services.

SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication)

A self-describing messaging format that is used within the banking and finance industry to support electronic funds transfer. SWIFT is also the name of the format’s creator, an organization that provides messaging and transaction-processing services to member banks and other financial organizations, including brokers, securities depositories, clearing organizations and stock exchanges.

In 2009 Nokia bought out the other owners and converted Symbian into an open source foundation. From 2010, Symbian will be run as an open source project managed by the Symbian Foundation, the governing body for open source Symbian.

$SYMBOLIC_LINK

This attribute This attribute, like $VOLUME_VERSION existed in NTFS v1.2, but wasn’t used. It does not longer exist in NTFS v3.0+.

synchronization

Establishment of common timing between sending and receiving equipment.

synchronous

Having a constant time interval between successive bits, characters or events. Synchronous transmission uses no redundant information to identify the beginning and end of characters, and is faster and more efficient than asynchronous transmission, which uses start and stop bits. The timing is achieved by transmitting sync characters prior to data; usually synchronization can be achieved in two-or three-character times.

synchronous communications

High-speed transmission of contiguous groups of characters. The stream of monitored and read bits uses a clock rate.

synchronous network

A network in which all the communications links are synchronized to a common clock.

synchronous transmission

Timing is achieved by transmitting sync characters prior to data. It does not use such redundant information as the start and stop bits in asynchronous transmission to identify the beginning and end of characters and is thus faster and more efficient.

SyncML (Synchronization Markup Language)

An initiative originally set up to develop a uniform synchronization protocol operating on any device over any network and among various vendors’ products. The protocol was intended to provide support for a wide range of transports and media types.

syntax

Message format or grammar (e.g., field lengths and delineators, headers, footers and optional fields).

systems management

Any of a number of “housekeeping” activities intended to preserve, maintain or correct the operation of a computer system. Included are such routine but critical processes as hardware diagnostics, software distribution, backup and recovery, file and disk integrity checking, and virus scanning.

systems integration

The process of creating a complex information system that may include designing or building a customized architecture or application, integrating it with new or existing hardware, packaged and custom software, and communications. Most enterprises rely on an external contractor for program management of most or all phases of system development. This external vendor generally also assumes a high degree of the project’s risks.

systems integrator

An organization or an individual that integrates two or more systems so they work together. For example, an organization can integrate its payroll system with its check processing system to process paychecks. System integration can be done internally or through an external contract. It requires specific technical knowledge of the programming languages. Major systems integration projects often require the assistance of a specialty firm that has the resources and expertise to manage a project plan that could last over several months or even years.

T

Common-carrier-provided, point-to-point digital line service used in private data networks and cellular, Wi-Fi and fixed-network backhaul. A T1 (so called because it was first sold by AT&T in the 1960s) delivers 1.544 Mbps capacity that can be split into multiple 64 Kbps channels, and is typically charged by distance. See also E1 and T3.

T3

Common-carrier-provided, point-to-point digital line service typically used in the Internet. A T3 line delivers 44.736 Mbps capacity that can be split into 672 x 64 Kbps voice or data channels, and is typically charged by distance. See also E1 and T1.

tacit knowledge

The personal knowledge resident within the mind, behavior and perceptions of individuals. Tacit knowledge includes skills, experiences, insight, intuition and judgment. Tacit knowledge is typically shared through discussion, stories, analogies and person-to-person interaction and is, therefore, difficult to capture or represent in explicit form. Because individuals continually add personal knowledge, which changes behavior and perceptions, tacit knowledge is, by definition, uncaptured.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

A set of protocols covering (approximately) the network and transport layers of the seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network model. TCP/IP was developed during a 15-year period under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Defense. It has achieved de facto standard status, particularly as higher-level layers over Ethernet.

TD-CDMA (time division duplexing-code division multiple access)

TD-CDMA and its Chinese cousin, TD-SCDMA, are 3GPP-approved time division duplexing (TDD) air interfaces defined by the UMTS 3G cellular mobile phone standard, and used mainly to provide Internet access. In TDD, the same spectrum is shared for the uplink and the downlink via time division. TD-CDMA uses 5MHz channels, each divided into 10 ms frames and each containing 15 time slots (1,500 per second). CDMA is used in each time slot to support multiple users. TD-SCDMA uses 1.6MHz channels.

In much of Europe and Asia, specific UMTS-TDD spectrums of 1,900MHz to 1,920 MHz and 2,010MHz to 2,025MHz have been set aside, and operators were often obliged to buy a TDD spectrum along with the UMTS-FDD paired-frequency spectrum they needed for 3G voice. A band of 2,500MHz to 2,690MHz has been used for TDD in some countries (for example, in the U.S.), and 3.5GHz in others (for example, in the U.K. and New Zealand). Although TD-SCDMA is still undergoing trials in China, TD-CDMA has been deployed in more than a dozen commercial wireless broadband and public-safety networks globally by IPWireless (NextWave). See also TD-SCDMA.

TDD (time division duplex)

Radio transmission technique in which the uplink and downlink share one channel, with the transmit and receive pulses separated by time. Users can be allocated multiple time slots in the uplink and downlink, permitting asymmetric data transmission.

TDM (time division multiplexing)

A data, voice and video communications technique that interleaves several low-speed signals into one high-speed transmission channel.

TDMA (time division multiple access)

Digital modulation technique that allocates a discrete amount of frequency bandwidth to each user to permit many simultaneous conversations. Each caller is assigned a specific time slot for transmission. TDMA provides improved spectral efficiencies over analog systems. A derivative of this standard used in North America is called NA-TDMA. Other TDMA-based cellular systems include GSM, D-AMPS, PDC, DECT and enhanced TDMA.

TDM extension line

A line that terminates with a digital or analog (non-IP) phone set that was shipped, installed, and in use and attached to an IP-enabled PBX or traditional PBX/KTS system.

TDOA (time difference of arrival)

Method of processing cellular phone signals to identify the location of a switched-on mobile phone. Based on triangulation, TDOA determines the position by comparing the time difference of the arrival of the reverse control channel at various cell sites. In ideal circumstances, accuracy is 50 meters to 150 meters, but the average is 150 meters to 200 meters. See also LBS.

TDR (time domain reflectometry)

A technique used to track faults in networks, such as cable breaks or loose connections. A pulse of a known shape is transmitted over the network and an echo is created when the pulse hits an obstacle or cable end. The time lapsed between the sending of the pulse and receiving the echo can be used to locate the origin of the echo and therefore the break. Sophisticated testing equipment is available to perform this test and to analyze the results.

TDS (telecommunications data systems)

A frequency allocation technique based on allotting discrete time slots to users, permitting many simultaneous transmissions.

TD-SCDMA (time division synchronous code division multiple access)

telecom equipment support services

This segment includes enterprise equipment services and infrastructure equipment services.

• Enterprise equipment services – Enterprise equipment consists of telecom equipment and systems that are based in business locations, and that connect either with the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or to private data voice networks.
• Carrier infrastructure equipment services – Infrastructure equipment includes all forms of equipment (and some systems and integrally related services) that combine to form the communications networks used by public service operators worldwide. A good example is the PSTN. Others include IP and other data networks as well as mobile networks. Infrastructure equipment includes six major building blocks: switching, transport, access, signaling, support and mobile infrastructure.

telecommunications carrier

Catch-all/generic phrase covering all entities that provide some form of telecommunication services (fixed and/or mobile; voice and/or data) as their primary business to all or a subset of consumers, enterprises, governments and other telecom service providers.

telecommunications equipment

Telecom equipment now includes mobile devices, PBX equipment (contact center, telephony and IP telephony), and network equipment (LAN and WAN).

Enterprise networking and communications – Enterprise networking and communications includes telecom equipment and systems that are based in consumer and business locations and that connect either with the PSTN or to private data or voice networks.

telecommunications services

Telecom services now include fixed-network services (data retail, Internet retail, voice retail and wholesale) and mobile services.

Fixed-data services – Includes all dedicated/private line, packet and circuit-switched access services (for example, frame relay, asynchronous transfer mode, IP, Integrated Services Digital Network, DSL, multichannel multipoint distribution service [MMDS] and satellite) retail revenue. No differentiation is made between the type of traffic or application carried by these services. All types of transmissions – nonvoice data, image, video, fax, interactive services and even voice – can be carried by these services regardless of whether the source format is analog or digital. All revenue reflects service provider annualized retail revenue – paid for by the business and residential end user of the service; no wholesale or carrier-to-carrier revenue is included.

Fixed-voice services – This reflects retail voice service revenue for all services that are sold as such to end users and includes the provision of local and long-distance services related to voice (calling charges, line rental/subscription and connection fees are included in this category), enhanced voice services, data and fax transmission over the circuit-switched PSTN, and retail voice over IP revenue – paid for by the business and residential end user of the service; no wholesale or carrier-to-carrier revenue is included.

Mobile telecom services – Income from mobile telephone calls and mobile data usage (Short Message Service [SMS] and mobile data access) from all mobile operators in that regional market. Consumer charges are removed. Income from mobile telephone calling charges, mobile data access, SMS charges, line rental/subscription and connection fees are included in this category.

Wholesale/carrier services are not included as a component of business IT spending. Wholesale/carrier services reflect carrier revenue from carrier-to-carrier service transactions.

teledensity

Number of fixed (landline) telephone connections per 100 people in a specified geographic area. Teledensity is often used to compare the level of access to voice and data communications services between metropolitan and rural areas, or between one country and another. The governments of many emerging economies are focused on increasing teledensity as an economic enabler. Because of fixed-mobile substitution, teledensity is decreasing in some countries. See also FMS.

telephony-centric UC approach

These solutions are extensions of IP PBX and unified messaging (UM) products. In many cases, UM is tightly integrated with PBX; in others, the two are offered by separate vendors. The functionality offered is telephony-centric and typically includes: one-number service, supporting phone twinning, softphones (which may be proprietary), remote phones (phone login over the Internet) and fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). Examples of PBX- and IP PBX-centric solutions include all the leading PBX vendors.

TEM (technology-enabled marketing)

Also known as marketing automation, TEM involves analyzing and automating the marketing process. Because the role of technology in all aspects of business is growing, marketing departments must make it a strategic imperative to use information and IT to build competitive differentiation. TEM includes a proactive strategy for using information and IT in marketing, with the ultimate goal of TEM is to allocate marketing resources to the activities, channels and media with the best potential return and impact on profitable customer relationships. The new metrics of customer profitability, customer lifetime value and share of customer will be needed to supplement the traditional metrics of market share and penetration. The components of TEM include:

• Data Cleansing: This involves the use of tools for data support (e.g., cleansing, manipulation and reconciliation) to produce quality data and data consistency.
• Data Analysis: Also called business intelligence, this involves the use of software for ad hoc query, reporting and analysis capabilities, supporting strategic decision-making processes with a data warehouse or data mart. A data warehouse is a consolidated database that stores all – or significant portions of – the data collected by an enterprise’s multiple business systems. Data from online transaction-processing applications and other sources is selectively collected, extracted, integrated, transformed and cleaned. A data mart contains a subset of the data typically found in a data warehouse and is designed to support the unique business intelligence requirements of a specific business process/application requirement.
• Content Management Systems: Also known as marketing content management (MCM) systems or marketing encyclopedia systems (MES), this category of applications allow enterprises to view and access marketing content.
• Campaign Management System (CMS): A CMS is a database management (DBM) tool used by marketers to design single-channel or multichannel marketing campaigns and track the effects of those campaigns by customer segment over time. CMS applications are also used by sales organizations to execute sales campaigns, such as achieving a specific market share with a particular product by a certain date.

TEO (technology exchange option)

A guaranteed residual value (RV) for equipment at 12-,18-, 24- and 30-month intervals that allows the user to use the RV toward the purchase of additional capacity, features or functionality, or toward trade-in for newer technology. TEOs guarantee that future acquisitions will be at a lower original discount rate or current average selling price.

TERM (technology-enabled relationship management)

The concept of forming one enterprisewide view of the customer across all customer contact channels (i.e., sales, marketing, and customer service and support). It is a complex area, requiring complex solutions to problems of integration, data flow, data access and marketing strategy. A critical component is the database that serves as the customer information repository.

terminal

A device, combining keyboard and display screen, that communicates with a computer. Terminals are divided into different classes depending on whether they are able to process data on their own.

• Dumb terminals – display monitor or simple input/output (I/O) devices that send and accept data from a network server or mainframe. They have no built-in processing capabilities. Workers enter data and commands, which are sent to a computer located elsewhere.
• Smart terminals – monitors that process limited amounts of information.
• Intelligent terminals – devices that contain main memory and a central processing unit (CPU) to perform special display functions. Examples include an information kiosk and AT&T Display Phones.
• 3270 terminals – IBM display stations used to communicate with mainframes made by IBM and other manufacturers. They are in widespread use, and are widely copied.

terminal emulation

Imitation of a specific terminal (VT100, for example) by a device, such as a PC, through software. PCs often use terminal emulation methods to connect to specific hosts, such as Digital Virtual Address Extensions (VAXs) or IBM mainframes, with which they would otherwise be incapable of communicating.

terminal job

In systems with time sharing, the processing done on behalf of one terminal user from log-on to log-off. See time sharing.

terminal server

A local-area network (LAN) device that allows asynchronous dumb terminals to communicate with a host computer also attached to the LAN. It is useful in minimizing the amount of cabling where several terminals need to be attached to a mainframe.

terminal user

In systems with time sharing, anyone who is eligible to log on. See time sharing.

TES (technology-enabled selling)

Also known as “sales automation” or “technology-enabled sales,” this refers to the application of technology to enable selling through all desired sales channels, including field/mobile sales, inside sales/telesales, selling partners (i.e., e-partners), Web selling (i.e., e-sales) and retail sales. The goal of TES is to integrate technology with optimal processes to provide continuous improvement in sales team effectiveness, as well as balance and optimize each enterprise sales channel. The components of TES include:

• Field sales: Also known as mobile sales or sales force automation (SFA), this includes applications for salespeople who most often work outside the boundaries of the enterprise and without the benefit of continuous LAN or high-speed WAN connections.
• Inside sales: Also known as telesales or inside selling, this involves applications for salespeople who most often work inside the boundaries of the enterprise and with the benefit of continuous LAN or high-speed WAN connections. To perform their jobs, they spend a majority of their time using the phone, the Web or e-mail.
• e-partner: Also known as extended selling enterprise (ESE), this includes applications and technologies provided by the enterprise to assist third-party selling channel partners (e.g., brokers, agents, distributors and value-added resellers) in achieving selling objectives.
• e-sales: Also known as technology-enabled buying (TEB), unassisted selling or Web selling, this component of TES involves customer-direct, business or consumer Web-selling applications. These are customer-facing technologies and applications that allow consumers and businesses to “sell themselves” and conduct transactions without the assistance of a salesperson.
• Retail sales: Includes applications that enable retailers to sell their products to consumers through traditional brick-and-mortar outlets (such as department stores, specialty shops and outlet malls) or via new options such as home shopping, the Internet and warehouse clubs. Merchandising, relationship marketing and e-retailing are typical examples of retail sales applications.

Communications instructions for forming files containing sets of information developed specifically to ensure the adequacy of a computer run or system.

tethered remote access

A terrestrial or nonmobile connection of individual users or small workgroups to a data source or network interface beyond the boundary defined by a building or campus. The connection is generally via a wide-area network (WAN), which, in most cases, is outside the sphere of ownership and management of the enterprise making the remote connection.

TETRA (terrestrial trunked radio)

ETSI standard for digital private mobile radio and public access mobile radio technology for police, ambulance and fire services, security services, utilities, the military, public access services, fleet management, transport services, closed user groups, factory site services, mining and other uses. TETRA is a TDMA-based system with four user channels on one radio carrier and 25kHz spacing between carriers.

text analytics

The application of linguistic and/or statistical techniques to extract concepts and patterns that enable the categorization and classification of text-based documents. These applications can transform “unstructured” text into “structured” data for processing in traditional business intelligence (BI)-type applications and in search engine applications. Text analytics can give users insight into previously inaccessible or prohibitively expensive-to-mine data sets.

text analytics program (TAP)

A TAP provides program management for text analytics initiatives. Organizations often accumulate numerous products and prepare categorization models and other analyses for small groups of users; this leads to duplicated efforts and inconsistent best practices. Future-development needs and platform investments may also be improperly specified. To address current and future business needs, a TAP is the best way for business and IT to jointly drive a comprehensive use of text analytics technology.

text mining

The process of extracting information from collections of textual data and utilizing it for business objectives.

text retrieval

Software used for finding units of textual information such as documents by matching a user’s search terms to those in a full-text index derived from the collection of textual units.

TFA (trusted financial advisor)

TFAs provide or facilitate access for their clients to consumer banking functions, budgeting and expense-tracking services and financial advice. They also serve as middlemen between individuals and prequalified best-of-breed financial-services vendors, actively seeking out “better deals” for their subscribers. It is not necessary for a TFA to be an existing financial-services provider because TFA functions can be fulfilled by a wide range of firms or by low-cost existing or developmental personal software products. All other functionality offered by the TFA can be outsourced.

THA (time horizon to action)

A measurement used in system compliance efforts, such as euro currency conversion. The THA is the time period between the present and the point at which at which conversion efforts must begin if the compliance deadline is to be met.

THC (time horizon to compliance)

A measurement used in system compliance efforts. The THC is the time period between the present and the point at which all systems must be compliant with a new format or requirement (e.g., euro currency support).

THD (time horizon to decision)

A measurement used in system compliance efforts, such as euro currency conversion. The THD is the time period between the present and the point at which a decision must be reached as to how compliance efforts will proceed (e.g., which systems must be changed, replaced or retired).

thermal printing

Thermal printing is a process that uses the heat from a thermal print head to darken chemically treated paper. Thermal paper is coated paper that reacts to heat. When the paper passes through the printer assembly, it comes into contact with a thermal print head array and the heater elements turn on to activate the thermal coating, creating the image. The only supply item used is thermal paper.

thermal transfer

An output device that creates the desired image one dot at a time, using point-specific heat to transfer ink from a ribbon to a receiving substrate.

THF (time horizon to failure)

Defines the date on which a system will cease to function properly if corrective action is not taken.

thin client

Term used to describe a type of client/server computing where applications are run, and data is stored, on the server rather than on the client. Because the applications are executed on the server, they do not require client-resident installation, although the graphical user interface and some application logic may be rendered to the client.

A common misperception is that a thin-client application requires the use of a thin-client device (i.e., a stripped-down desktop machine that costs less to buy and maintain than a regular PC). However, while thin-client applications enable such devices to be used, they do not require it. In fact, more than 85 percent of devices used to display thin-client Windows applications are regular PCs, typically configured with both “fat-client” applications and access to thin-client ones.

three-schema architecture

A framework for managing access to data that involves three layers or schemas: the external or programming view, the conceptual or data administration view, and the internal or database administration view. Such ideas were developed by an American National Standards Institute/Scalable Processor Architecture subcommittee in 1971 but received little practical implementation by database management system (DBMS) vendors. The principle is that the conceptual schema consists of business rules derived from a semantic data model, which provides independence between programs and data structures. The emphasis has since shifted to computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools and “repository” standards.

throughput

A computer term for the volume of work or information flowing through a system. Particularly meaningful in information storage and retrieval systems, in which throughput is measured in units such as accesses per hour.

tightly bundled UC approach

These solutions provide a broad set of UC functionality. They offer a high degree of integration across the components, which are typically built into a media server handling a broad range of real-time communications functions. Functionality usually includes integrated audio conferencing, Web conferencing, videoconferencing, rich presence, IM and one or more desktop-client options. These sometimes also include softphone functionality, find-me and one-number services, some mobility services, and basic telephony capabilities built around Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This functionality is integrated with complete PBX capabilities, which are often on a separate application server. These solutions don’t provide e-mail, but will integrate with leading e-mail platforms.

TIM (transaction incident management)

The art and practice of ensuring that business transactions enable users, consumers and suppliers to perform business transaction tasks securely and in privacy according to business specifications and service-level agreements. The objectives of TIM are to detect any kind of abnormal incidents in real time and to resolve them rapidly, depending on their levels of business criticality.

time-division signaling

Signaling over a time-division multiplex system in which all voice channels share a common signaling channel, with time division providing the separation between signaling channels.

time-division switching

The switching method for a time-division multiplexing (TDM) channel requiring the shifting of data from one slot to another in the TDM frame. The slot in question can carry a bit, a byte, or, in principle, any other unit of data.

time out

The set time period before a terminal system performs some action. Typical uses include a poll release (when a terminal is disconnected if the time-out period elapses before keying resumes) or an access time out (when a terminal on a local area network is prevented from transmitting for a specified time period).

Time Stamp

NTFS stores four significant times referring to files and directories. They are: File creation time; Last modification time; Last modification of the MFT record; Last access time. NTFS stores dates as the number of 100ns units since Jan 1st 1601. Unix, stores dates as the number of seconds since Jan 1st 1970.

TISPAN (Telecommunications and Internet Converged Services and Protocols for Advanced Networking)

TLM (technical license management)

TLP (transmission-level point)

Any point in a transmission system at which the power level of the signal is measured.

TLS (transport layer security)

Internet-based transaction security provided by the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

TMG (trunk media gateways)

A trunk media gateway (TMG) serves as the bridge between a circuit-based trunk switch and a packet-based IP or ATM backbone network. In certain implementations, it completely bypasses the tandem switch (Class 4). It takes care of the PSTN-to-packet-network transition at the trunk level and is connected to the local or trunk exchange. A TMG has a Class 4 interface and supports VoIP and/or VoATM.

T-MPLS (Transport Multiprotocol Label Switching)

TMS (transportation management system)

System used to plan freight movements, do freight rating and shopping across all modes, select the appropriate route and carrier, and manage freight bills and payments.

TOA (time of arrival)

Measures the arrival times of a signal from a mobile device to three network base stations to calculate the location by triangulation. It requires synchronization of base stations, which is not supported by GSM and has a rather long response time (about 10 seconds). Accuracy in ideal circumstances is 50 meters to 150 meters, but 150 meters to 200 meters on average. See also LBS.

token bus

A local network access mechanism and topology in which all stations actively attached to the bus listen for a broadcast token or supervisory frame. Stations wishing to transmit must receive the token before doing so; however, the next physical station to transmit is not necessarily the next physical station on the bus. Bus access is controlled by preassigned priority algorithms.

token passing

A LAN access technique in which participating stations circulate a special bit pattern that grants access to the communications pathway to any station that holds the sequence. It is often used in networks with a ring topology.

token ring

A LAN access mechanism and topology in which a supervisory frame or token is passed from station to station in sequential order. Stations wishing to gain access to the network must wait for the token to arrive before transmitting data. In a token ring, the next logical station receiving the token is also the next physical station on the ring. The ring may be a logical, rather than physical, ring in the case of switched token ring.

total connections

Number of individual (mobile) network connections at the end of a given period. In this regard, multiple SIM cards bearing one number would count as one connection, while two numbers associated with one SIM card would count as two connections. Prepaid SIM cards would count as one connection, provided that they are in operation at the end of the given year. Total connections include connections that are inactive but still in operation.

total IPTV subscribers

The previously described business models define the total IPTV subscriber market, with each representing an STB installed in a home and capable of receiving some form of IPTV. The STB may be free, rented or bought by the customer. Additional services such as premium channels, VOD and person-to-person video-calling can only be sold only after a subscriber has an STB.

In certain specific cases consumers receive IPTV for “free” or by default as part of a “triple play” bundle of wireline voice, IPTV/video and broadband Internet. In other words, IPTV is supplied to them whether they want it or not – they do not really make a choice to buy it.

These subscribers receive from their IPTV provider a “free” STB and access to a small selection of channels, in return for signing a longer-term contract for broadband or a voice/broadband package. This category of IPTV subscriber does not have an equivalent in the existing pay-TV environment. It reflects the need for new IPTV operators to find ways to popularize the service.

Hong Kong provides a good example. The carrier PCCW offers all its long-term broadband customers a “free” STB and access to a small number of channels. Though many of these customers may choose to buy extra channels, a sizable proportion stick with only the free channels – if, indeed, they use the IPTV service at all.

In France, the carrier Free offers all its subscribers a home gateway device with STB capability built-in. All Free’s customers who live close enough to its asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)-enabled exchanges receive a selection of basic IPTV channels automatically for no extra payment.

total revenue

AWP multiplied by the sum of the manufacturer’s sales to end users.

total service revenue

Sum of value-added service revenue, connection revenue, subscription revenue and call-charge revenue accrued by a mobile communications service provider.

touchpoint

A contact point between an enterprise and its customers. Touchpoints may occur in any channel (e.g., via phone, the Web or direct contact with a salesperson).

touch-sensitive

Refers to the technology that enables a system to identify a point of contact on the screen by coordinates and transmit that information to a program.

TP (transaction processing)

A mode of processing characterized by short transactions recording business events that normally requires high availability and consistent, short response times. A category of application that requires a request for service to be answered within a predictable period that approaches real time, and a transaction that transforms this model from one business state to another. Tasks such as making reservations, scheduling and inventory control are especially complex; all the information must be current.

TPC (Transaction Processing Performance Council)

An organization that has developed several standardized transaction processing (TP) benchmarks, among which are TPC-A, TPC-B, and TPC-C. TPC prohibits testing systems that are specially optimized for benchmarking or lack real-world applicability.

TPC-A (Transaction Processing Performance Council Benchmark A)

A revised and superior version of the debit/credit online transaction processing (OLTP) benchmark. Ratified in late 1989, it came into widespread use in 1990. The major improvements in TPC-A were the requirements for full disclosure and the inclusion of the front-end network and terminals. TPC-A is intended to replace debit/credit as the only industrywide measure for OLTP performance and price/performance. It is a good test since it measures end-to-end performance, but it still is only one test reflecting a single type of transaction.

TPM (transaction processing monitor)

The earliest form of platform middleware was the mainframe TPM. Products such as IBM’s CICS and IMS and Unisys’ TIP have been used on mainframes since the late 1960s. Unix-based distributed TPMs, such as BEA’s Tuxedo (now owned by Oracle), NCR’s Top End and IBM’s Encina, originated in the 1980s. Through the years, these products added support for distributed servers, intelligent desktop clients (rather than dumb terminals) and Web browser clients, and component support using CORBA or Java EE architecture.

TPS (Toyota Production System)

Acronym for Toyota Production System, the approach that Toyota takes to managing its processes; and often thought of as synonymous with lean.

trace packet

In packet switching, a special kind of packet that functions as a normal packet but causes a report of each stage of its progress to be sent to the network control center.

traditional processing

The availability of traditional and basic data processing facilities at the midrange system. Examples include sequential and keyed files, compilers such as COBOL, FORTRAN, PL/I, BASIC and C, interactive access, batch processing, multiprocessing and multitasking.

traffic

Quantitative measurement of the total messages and their length, expressed in hundred call seconds (CCS) or other units.

traffic flow

The measure of the density of traffic on a telephone network expressed in Erlangs.

traffic matrix

Matrix of which the X, Y element contains the amount of traffic originated at node X and destined for node Y. The unit of measurement may be telephone calls or data packets per second, depending on the kind of network.

TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India)

The telecommunications regulator in the Republic of India. See also Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.

train time

The initialization time for full-duplex operation on a modem.

transaction

A logical update that takes a database from one consistent state to another. A transaction on a system is a set of operations (on that system) that constitutes a unit. This unit can’t be divided. Before the transaction, the state of the system is well defined. During the transaction, it is undefined. After the transaction, it is well defined again. A transaction can’t be half-realized: if no operation fails, the transaction is realized. If on the contrary an error occurs in one or more of the operations, the transaction is not realized. A set of (even atomic) operations is not atomic by definition. A transaction is a model that provides a kind of atomicity to this set of operations.

transaction logging

A concept in which a detailed record is kept of all operations in a transaction; in case of a failure, the transaction could be backed out and the former state reconstructed.

transaction monitor

A subsystem that ensures that all transactions against a database leave it in a consistent state or, in case of a transaction failure, returns the database to its pre-transaction state.

transceiver

A device that can transmit and receive traffic. It is used to connect nodes to Ethernet (LAN).

transcoding server

See gateway (transcoding) server.

transducer

transfer rate

The speed at which information can be sent across a bus or communications link.

transit VLAN starvation

The condition a switch suffers in a non-ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) network when it becomes congested and cells or cell streams representing Layer 3 virtual local-area network (VLAN) packets are missed or dropped, leading to the VLAN becoming unstable. Also known as beatdown.

translator

A device that converts information from one system of representation into equivalent information in another system of representation.

transmission

Sending information in the form of electrical signals over electric wires, waveguides, or radio.

To send information from one location to another.

transparency

If a signal passes through a network or facility unchanged, that network or facility is said to be transparent to it.

transponder

Transmitter-receiver device on a satellite that transmits signals automatically when it receives pre-determined signals. The term “satellite transponder” refers collectively to a transmitter-receiver subsystem on board the satellite that processes, amplifies and retransmits a range of frequencies (the transponder bandwidth) to another location/terminal/antenna on the earth. There are many transponders on a typical satellite, each capable of supporting one or more communication channels. In a few limited instances, satellite transponders can transmit directly to other satellites; this is known as satellite mesh topologies. These systems tend to be more expensive to build, and services are more expensive for end users.

transportation planning and scheduling

Specifies how, when and where to transport goods. Transportation planning and scheduling applications may provide weight/size restrictions, merge-in-transit, continuous move, mode or carrier selection, and truckload planning functionality.

treasury and trading

A bank treasury manages the bank’s liquidity, along with interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks arising from market conditions. The capital market trading activity, also called “treasury,” encompasses different functions. Trading uses many financial instruments across various asset classes; the instruments with which it deals are more complex; a premium is placed on timely information and execution capabilities, because of the speed of capital markets; and transaction volumes tend to be higher than in the bank treasury. Bank treasury operations increasingly are also entering the capital markets to better align a bank’s cash flows and exposures. This latter activity is blurring the distinction between the two treasuries.

tree

A type of bus network topology in which the medium branches at certain points along its length connect stations or clusters of stations. Also called a branching bus.

Trellis Coding

A method of modulation that combines both amplitude and phase.

tri-band

Mobile device that supports voice and data communications conforming to one bearer technology, such as GSM, but on three different sets of frequencies. For example, many European and Asia/Pacific countries/markets have licensed deployment of GSM networks on a 900MHz and 1,800MHz spectrum, and in North America GSM has been deployed on 1,900MHz. A tri-band phone enables the user to roam automatically among networks on any of these frequencies in any of these countries, providing its home operator has roaming agreements with local mobile network operators. See also dual-band and dual-mode.

TRIZ

An abbreviation of the Russian expression for “theory of innovative problem solving” consisting of nine distinct action steps that relate to 40 basic principles.

Trojan horse

A form of malicious code that may be deliberately planted to perform a destructive act on a computer. It is effective because it is not what it appears to be. That is, the execution of a Trojan horse may have an undesirable and unexpected effect on the user’s work environment, but it is the user who initiates the execution of the code (e.g., by clicking on a button in a graphical user interface that appears harmless). Unlike a computer virus, a Trojan horse is unable to replicate and is not parasitic.

trouble ticket

A record of a customer complaint or problem, usually created in a call or contact center. The ticket remains active until the issue has been resolved.

TRX

Radio transceiver that is part of a BTS. Each TRX supports a number of channels that are dependent on the radio access technology.

turnaround time

The time required to reverse the direction of transmission, e.g., to change from receive mode to transmit mode in order to acknowledge on a half-duplex line when individual blocks are acknowledged, as is required in certain protocols. The turnaround time has a major effect on throughput, particularly if the propagation delay is lengthy, such as on a satellite channel.

turnkey system

A complete communications system, including hardware and software, assembled and installed by a vendor and sold as a total package.

Type A, B and C enterprises

A framework that classifies enterprises or their subdivisions according to a technology adoption profile. Classification is based not only on an enterprise’s current technology adoption strategy, but also on whether the strategy is supported by top management and is adequately funded.

• Type A enterprises are typically technically aggressive and well-funded, and use information technology (IT) to gain a competitive advantage.
• Type B enterprises, which are in the majority, are mainstream IT users with adequate funding that use IT for productivity.
• Type C enterprises are technologically conservative and risk-averse, and seek to control IT costs.

Recognizing an enterprise’s type offers company strategists a meaningful way to compare an enterprise’s use of technology against that of competitors, and to make decisions about when, how and where to adopt new technologies.

U

Unix

Originally developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories, Unix is a multitasking, multiuser OS, which is portable to multiple server platforms. It also was developed as an open alternative to proprietary minicomputer OSs. Today, Unix can be found on platforms based on Intel’s Itanium product family and Xeon, AMD’s Opteron, IBM’s Power, HP’s PA-RISC, Sun and Fujitsu’s UltraSPARC and SPARC-64, and other reduced instruction set computer (RISC) platforms.

We segment software running on Unix OSs into these categories:

• Sun Solaris
• IBM AIX
• HP-UX
• Mac OS
• Other Unix, including Tru64, IRIX and other unspecified Unix

$UpCase

This metadata file contains 128KB of capital letters. For each character in the Unicode alphabet, there is an entry in this file. It is used to compare and sort filenames.

Update Sequence

Several structures in NTFS have sequence numbers in them to check for consistency errors. They are FILE, INDX, RCRD and RSTR records. Before the record is written to disk, the last two bytes of each sector are copied to an array in the header. The update sequence number is then incremented and written to the end of each sector. If any disk corruption occurs, this technique could detect it.

See also: FILE Record INDX Record RCRD Record RSTR Record

uplink

Communication link from the earth station or ground-based satellite terminal/antenna to the orbiting satellite. See also downlink.

UPOS (unified point of service)

An international initiative to produce an architectural specification that is both operating-system-independent and language-neutral for retail point of sale (POS) systems, standardizing the POS application programming interfaces (APIs). While UPOS specifies the APIs for peripheral devices, such as scanners, printers and cash drawers, JavaPOS and OPOS outline the implementations, mapping the architecture to a retailer’s specific hardware and software computing environment.

UPS (uninterruptible power supply)

A device that provides temporary power upon failure of the main power source.

URL (uniform resource locator)

The character string that identifies an Internet document’s exact name and location.

It simplifies peripheral connections via a “daisy chaining” scheme whereby the desktop system has only one I/O port to which all peripherals are connected in a series. Up to 120 peripherals can be connected to a single system.

user provisioning

User provisioning encompasses user account management (creating, modifying and deleting user accounts and privileges) for access to heterogeneous IT resources. Enterprises typically use user provisioning to manage internal user access. User provisioning products act as the single point of administration for legacy and client/server application environments, as well as for corporate utilities, such as e-mail. Most user provisioning products offer password management functionality, delegated administration, a role-based access control model, workflow (a distinguishing feature from earlier consolidated security administration products) and automated fulfillment of the access request. Some products offer synchronization of user profile information among authoritative sources of user identity information.

USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module)

Enhancement of the GSM SIM card that is designed to be used in UMTS networks.

$UsnJrnl

used for logging

USSD (unstructured supplementary service data)

UTRA (Universal Terrestrial Radio Access)

UMTS system supporting TDD and FDD access.

UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network)

Defines the radio portion of the network, including B nodes and RNCs.

UWB (ultrawideband)

Also known as pulse radio, UWB is an emerging wireless technology that uses pulsed radio techniques to transmit data. The transmitter sends a low-power broadband signal, with each channel ranging from 10 million to 40 million pulses per second. The correlator, which knows the timing code of the transmitter, listens at these intervals and decodes the signal. UWB uses OFDM and very wide frequency bands, occupying several gigahertz of spectrum. The IEEE 802.15.3 Task Group 3a considering UWB standards was disbanded in January 2006 after a long stalemate between two warring factions: MB-OFDM UWB, supported by the WiMedia Alliance, and direct-sequence UWB, supported by the UWB Forum. However, the Alliance announced in March 2009 that it would be disbanded after it had transferred its specifications to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, the USB Promoter Group and the USB Implementers’ Forum. See also MB-OFDM.

VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)

A version of Microsoft’s Visual Basic used to create basic and customized programs.

VBR (variable bit rate)

An asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) quality of service category, defined by the ATM Forum. Both real-time variable bit rate (rtVBR) and non real-time variable bit rate (nrtVBR) are defined. Apart from the traffic parameters for peak cell rate (PCR) and sustainable cell rate (which defines the average bit rate required by the application), additional quality-of-service parameters such as maximum cell transfer delay, cell delay variation and maximum burst size must be agreed upon. The typical application for which it is used is compressed voice and videoconferencing for rtVBR, and response-time-sensitive data such as Systems Network Architecture (SNA) for nrtVBR.

VBScript

A Microsoft proprietary language derived from Visual Basic (VB). Like JavaScript, VBScript is intended for use as a browser-based language, a server-side (Active Server Pages – ASP) language, and an administrative (Windows Scripting Host – WSH) language. Unlike JavaScript, support for it in browsers is limited to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer.

A vendor is the last entity in the chain that brands a product and sells it directly to end users or through a channel. A vendor may design and manufacture its own products, assemble complete systems from components produced by others, or procure products from an original equipment or contract manufacturer. A vendor may also provide services, maintenance or nonmaintenance for its own products or for other vendors’ products and may also provide services for IT technologies.

vendor management

Vendor management is a discipline that enables organizations to control costs, drive service excellence and mitigate risks to gain increased value from their vendors throughout the deal life cycle…

vendor-neutral

A state in which no one vendor can control the definition, revision or distribution of a specification. Vendor-neutral specifications encourage the development of competing yet compatible implementations, freeing the purchaser to choose from a multitude of vendors without suffering a loss of functionality. Vendor-neutral specifications must be comprehensive, consistent, and either publicly available or licensed at a nominal fee. Additionally, they must be defined by a multilateral association that is representative of a broad cross-section of the computer industry, open to new members, publishes the rules of membership and operates according to democratic principles. Preferably, a vendor-neutral specification is supplemented with at least one reference implementation. This reference would be available in a format that allows re-creation – that format would be source code for software implementations – and a set of conformance tests that sufficiently ensure the implementation’s integrity under all reasonable conditions of projected use.

vendor revenue

Revenue earned by technology providers for the sale of printer, copier and MFP hardware (that is, excluding supplies). It would be calculated by end-user spending minus channel margins.

vendor risk management

Vendor risk management is the process of ensuring that the use of third-party service providers and IT suppliers does not create an unacceptable potential for business disruption or a negative impact on business performance.

vendor/technology provider

The last entity that brands a product and sells it directly to the end users or through a channel. A vendor, also called technology provider, may design and manufacture its own products, assemble complete systems from components produced by others, or procure products from an OEM or contract manufacturer. A technology provider may also provide services for its own products or for other technology providers’ products, and may also provide services for other technologies. Subsidiaries with different brands will be considered as a technology provider only if they maintain a separate marketing, sales and support structure independent of the parent company.

vendor total software revenue

This includes the revenue of a manufacturer or vendor that is generated by sales of software and software maintenance and support services. It excludes revenue from professional services and the sale of products manufactured by other vendors.

See also: Cluster, LCN and Volume.

virtualization

IT virtualization is the abstraction of IT resources in a way that masks the physical nature and boundaries of those resources from resource users. An IT resource can be a server, a client, storage, networks, applications or operating systems. Essentially, any IT building block can potentially be abstracted from resource users.

virtualization software

The virtualization software market includes all software products that are sold as value-added options to run on an x86 server or a desktop to create or manage a specific virtualized environment. Revenue is for new license sales and for maintenance and support services that include new version license sales to update an existing license to a new version, telephone support and on-site remedial support. Revenue does not include professional services. For products to be included in this coverage, they must represent a revenue stream for the company that is separately tracked and not be only part of a bundled product or service.

The virtualization software market is divided into three segments: server virtualization infrastructure, server virtualization management and HVDs. Other forms of virtualization software, such as application virtualization, shared OS virtualization, mainframe virtualization and thin provisioning, are not included in specific virtualization revenue reporting at this time.

virtual network operator

An entity that does not own a telecom network infrastructure but provides telecom services by purchasing capacity from telecom carriers.

virtual storage

A computer that appears to have a much larger memory than its real memory. This is accomplished by software that moves pages rapidly in and out of a high-speed, random-access storage device, usually a disk.

virtual tape library (VTL)

A virtual tape library is a disk appliance that has special software that makes the device appear as a physical tape drive or tape library to the backup application; the device is accessed through standard tape interfaces. The backup software believes it is writing the backup data to a real tape cartridge when it is, in fact, writing to a specially configured file on the disk appliance. Similarly, the backup software will use the appliance for recovery, accessing the device as if the recovery is coming from tape, when it is actually being transferred from disk spindles on the appliance.

At its essence, a VTL is both a disk-based appliance and a tape-like interface.

virus

Software used to infect a computer. After the virus code is written, it is buried within an existing program. Once that program is executed, the virus code is activated and attaches copies of itself to other programs in the system. Infected programs copy the virus to other programs.

visualization

To illustrate information objects and their relationships on a display. Strategic visualization graphically illustrates the strength of relationships by the proximity of objects on the display. Advanced technology can make a significant difference in users’ ability to interface to large knowledge repositories. These advances use the distance between objects on the display to reflect the similarity of meaning, similarity of content or other relationships (e.g., association with a group).

visualization-centric data discovery tool

Centrifuge complies with the definition of a visualization-centric data discovery tool, in that it has an intuitive interface enabling users to explore data with minimal training, a proprietary data structure and a RAM-based performance layer.

VLAN (virtual LAN)

A virtual LAN (local-area network) is a set of systems that, regardless of higher-layer addressing or location, is designated as a logical LAN and treated as a set of contiguous systems on a single LAN segment. Virtual LANs can be proprietary or standardized using the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1Q. Typical grouping parameters for VLANs include the port number of the hub, switch or router, the higher-layer protocol such as Internet Protocol (IP) or Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), the Media Access Control (MAC) address, and the traditional subnet. The goal of VLANs is to provide simpler administration, simple moves/adds/changes to network devices, and partitioning at the MAC layer.

VLR (Visitor Location Register)

Server in a cellular network that supports roaming functions for users outside the coverage area of their own HLR. The VLR uses Signaling System 7 to obtain information about the user from the HLR, and then establishes a temporary record on the VLR while the user is within the VLR coverage area, ensuring mobility management and call-handling functions.

VLSI (very large-scale integration)

A technology that makes it possible to place the equivalent of between 100,000 and 1 million transistors on a chip.

VM (virtual machine)

A software implementation of a hardware-like architecture, which executes predefined instructions in a fashion similar to a physical central processing unit (CPU). A VM can be used to create a cross-platform computing environment that loads and runs on computers independently of their underlying CPUs and operating systems. A notable example is the Java Virtual Machine, the environment created on a host computer to run Java applets. Although VMs have existed longer than Java, Java has made VMs highly visible (see Java).

VoATM (voice over ATM)

VOC (voice of customer)

Voice of customer; the activities that ensure that customer wants and needs are articulated.

VOD (video on demand)

The ability to offer VOD is an important strength of IPTV, though one that will take some time to mature. VOD is generally seen as additional to the main broadcast channels; it generates very little revenue at present, as users need time to adjust to becoming active rather than passive viewers. VOD is usually offered in combination with multichannel pay-TV services. In a few cases, service providers cannot or do not want to offer multichannel TV, leaving VOD as the only IPTV service available; we classify users in this situation as VOD-only IPTV subscribers.

VOD is a generic term covering several areas. It includes all video content requested on-demand by users. This could be premium movies or libraries of TV shows, sporting events or concerts. It could also include user-created video content. In addition, some IPTV operators are starting to offer the ability to see all the TV programs aired on their multichannel pay-TV channels in the previous 24 or 48 hours on demand. This video content is held in a constantly updated library hosted by their network.

VOD services are sold either on a pay-per-view basis or as monthly subscriptions. Bundling in flat-rate packages with multichannel subscriptions is also common. Our definition of VOD excludes free VOD downloads, which may be used to increase customers’ awareness of these services or to generate advertising revenue.

VoDSL (voice over DSL)

voice application servers

Voice application servers consist primarily of software, operating on Sun or Linux servers located in a service provider network, and functioning in conjunction with other standard network elements such as routers, gateways, integrated access devices (IADs) and telephones. This category is made up of IP-SCPs and IP Centrex platforms.

voice band

A voice-grade channel.

voice browser

System that enables telephone access to voice portal sites. It prepares and presents information to callers. It also interprets commands and enables navigation. Architectures and implementations vary, but many will use VoiceXML or a similar protocol to access the portal application. This is sometimes called a VoiceXML gateway.

This device, also known as an xDSL IAD, is part of a voice-over-DSL solution. It enables the bundling of multiple derived voice lines, high-speed data and continuous Internet access over a single DSL connection. It typically combines a DSL modem with a router, firewall and varying plain old telephone service (POTS) port configurations. It can be a wired device or include a wireless access point.

voice encryption

A function that enables a device to transport digitized voice signals.

voice endpoint

The description that defines a voice device, like a telephone, as a terminating device. This could be a physical extension or a logical IP address. This particularly applies to IP telephones where 100% IP system functions are not fully used for voice telephones and terminals.

voice-grade channel

A channel with bandwidth equivalent to a telephone line obtained through the public telephone network. The maximum potential bandwidth of a voice-grade channel is approximately 20 kilohertz (KHz); however, most voice grade channels in a transmission facility are usually spaced 4,000 hertz (Hz) apart, and not all of that bandwidth is generally available to a user due to the presence of noise-limiting loading coils. The telephone network itself is usually defined in terms of channels, with frequencies from 300 to 3,400 Hz.

voice mail

Network system that enables unanswered phone calls to be diverted to a personal answering service. Revenue may be generated by making a connection charge to the service, a subscription charge for the service, or by charging the subscriber for messages deposited or retrieved.

voice-messaging system

Also called voice mail and, incorrectly, voice-processing systems. Voice-messaging systems are hardware and software products that operate with most private branch exchange (PBX), hybrid, or key telephone systems, enabling users to send, receive, and redirect voice messages through office telephone systems and computers. Voice-messaging hardware includes a central processor, analog-to-digital converters, disk storage and input/output ports.

voice-operated device

A piece of equipment that can be controlled by spoken commands.

voice over IP

See VoIP.

voice over wireless local-area network

See VoWLAN.

Key components of most voice portals are speech recognition, text to speech, information aggregation, categorization software, telephony and Internet interfaces, and administrative interfaces. Optional components include software to support context-sensitive, personalized assistance (for example, an intelligent assistant) and support for VoiceXML.

voice-processing system

A hardware and/or software product that encompass voice messaging, voice recognition, voice response and any other applications that deal with the processing of voice communications.

voice recognition

A hardware and software system that translates human speech into binary text. Also called speech recognition.

voice switching, control and applications

In its widest sense, switching refers to the functions performed in a network that alter the path taken by information as it traverses that network, whether in real time or near real time. In this sense, switching includes packet-routing technologies (for example, Internet Protocol [IP], asynchronous transfer mode [ATM] and frame relay). The markets tracked in the switching category include well-known ones, such as softswitches, call session control function (CSCF), application servers and media gateways.

Signaling defines the control plane of a network and can include in-band or out-of-band connections. It is a specialized, rapidly changing and important topic. Signaling deals with the protocols and technology required to enable network equipment to communicate for the purposes of altering connectivity or getting database information. As such, it includes topic areas such as Signaling System 7 (SS7) common channel signaling, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.323, Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP), next-generation intelligent networks (NG INs) and advanced intelligent networks (AINs). Data topics include Q.2931 ATM (broadband), Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP), Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and routing protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Routing Information Protocol (RIP).

Transitioning to IP from time division multiplexing (TDM) networks has enabled service providers to provide voice over IP (VoIP) to subscribers in both fixed and mobile networks. VoIP is a term for transmission technologies that allow delivery of voice communications over IP networks, such as the Internet or other packet-switched networks. Other terms frequently encountered and synonymous with VoIP are IP telephony, Internet telephony and voice over broadband (VoBB). Most VoIP systems interface with traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN) equipment to convert TDM to IP for transitioning to an all-IP network. VoIP adoption in the consumer and enterprise space has not been as quick as anticipated because of continued reliability issues, consumer lack of understanding, latency, jitter, packet loss and increased security risks. However, ongoing technology developments will improve the quality of service (QoS), as well as ensure a more secure communications network.

VoIP switching equipment is measured by revenue and includes the following market segments: softswitches, media gateways, voice application servers, signaling gateways and session border controllers (SBCs).

VSAT (very small aperture terminal)

Small-sized earth station used in the transmit/receive of data, voice and video signals over a satellite communication network, excluding broadcast television. A VSAT consists of two parts: a transceiver placed outdoors in direct line of sight to the satellite, and a device that is placed indoors to interface the transceiver with the end user’s communications device, such as a PC. The transceiver receives or sends a signal to a satellite transponder in the sky. The satellite sends and receives signals from a ground station computer that acts as a hub for the system. Each end user is interconnected with the hub station via the satellite, forming a star topology. The hub controls the entire operation of the network. For one end user to communicate with another, each transmission must first go to the hub station, which then retransmits it via the satellite to the other end user’s VSAT.

VSAT data throughput speeds have increased significantly throughout the years and now can provide multimegabit service in downstream and upstream. Antenna/dish sizes usually range from 1.2 meters to approximately 3 meters in diameter. Generally, these systems operate in Ku-band and C-band frequencies, but with the launch of Ka-band satellites by a number of operators in North America and Asia/Pacific, and with newer Ka-band satellites planned for Europe, high-bandwidth, bidirectional VSAT services for enterprise, government and other users will increasingly migrate to these satellites.

VSF (voice store-and-forward)

Web conferencing and shared work spaces/team collaboration

Web conferencing products are synchronous in nature and support interaction between participants in a meeting or presentation format. Web conferencing consists of real-time electronic meeting and content delivery, screen and application sharing, text chat, and group document markup with electronic whiteboarding, augmented by audio, data and video. More-advanced features include integrated voice over IP audio, file sharing, remote control, content archiving, media streaming and polling.

Shared work spaces are team-oriented collaboration tools that provide virtual work spaces for sharing documents and files, supporting asynchronous and real-time collaboration activities, such as threaded discussions, document-based collaboration and chat functions.

Other forms of collaboration that are not included in this market definition include IM and chat, videoconferencing, audioconferencing, and a wide variety of social software, such as blogs, communities of practice, social bookmarking and tagging, expertise location, social network analysis, and wikis. A blog represents a form of asynchronous but collective Web publishing, usually in a journal-writing style. A community of practice represents a group of people engaged in joint experiences and shared practices, and it is similar to a network of Web bloggers. A wiki is a discussion system that includes server software for Web-based editing of, and commenting on, content created by others.

Web services

A software concept and infrastructure – supported by several major computing vendors (notably Microsoft and IBM) – for program-to-program communication and application component delivery. The Web services concept treats software as a set of services accessible over ubiquitous networks using Web-based standards and protocols.

Specifically, a Web service is a software component can be accessed by another application (such as a client, a server or another Web service) through the use of generally available, ubiquitous protocols and transports, such as Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP). Joint efforts between IBM and Microsoft, with the support of other vendors such as Ariba and Iona Technologies, have produced agreement on a basic set of XML-based standards for Web service interface definition, discovery and remote calling. They include:

• Web Services Description Language (WSDL) for describing Web service interfaces
• Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) as the means for users to publish and locate available Web services, their characteristics and interfaces
• Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which enables an application to call a Web service

See HTTP, .NET, SOAP, UDDI, WSDL and XML.

Web services software

Deploying Web-services-enabled software will be an evolutionary process, not a revolutionary one. The majority of software vendors have committed to supporting Web services software standards within their established product lines, but it will take more than four years to evolve these immature standards, build up skills, and plan, build and test for new versions of software that gradually incorporate these standards. Web services standards will be deployed through multiple markets, such as integration suites, AD tools and some enterprise application segments.

Website

A collection of files accessed through a Web address, covering a particular theme or subject, and managed by a particular person or organization. Its opening page is called a home page. A Website resides on servers connected to the Web network and is able to format and send information requested by worldwide users 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Websites typically use HTML to format and present information and to provide navigational facilities that make it easy for the user to move within the site and around the Web.

Web TV

Web TV services enable a user to access the Web on a television set using a special remote control and a decoder that sits on top of the TV.

WTAI (Wireless Telephony Application Interface)

Specifies how WAP applications can access mobile phone functionality (for example, to initiate a call or send an SMS message).

WTLS (Wireless Transport Layer Security)

Within the WAP framework, WTLS provides security functions similar to those of the secure sockets layer protocol used on the Web. Vendors such as Entrust, Baltimore Technologies and Certicom have announced software development toolkits to enable application developers to build WTLS support into WAP gateway and cell phone software. The initial focus of WTLS is the use of digital certificates at the WAP gateway to provide strong authentication to the cell phone that it is connected to a legitimate server. This involves cell phones being pre-loaded with root certificates signed by certificate authorities with which the wireless device manufacturer has entered into trust relationships.

WTP (Wireless Transaction Protocol)

In the WAP framework, WTP runs on top of a datagram service, such as WDP, to provide a simplified protocol suitable for low-bandwidth mobile applications. The protocol offers three classes of transaction service:

• Unreliable one-way request.
• Reliable one-way request.
• Reliable two-way request/respond.

X

XHTML Basic (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language Basic)

Supported in WAP 2.0, XHTML Basic is a subset of the XHTML constructs that enable authors to create Web content deliverable to a range of devices (including mobile phones, PDAs, pagers and TV-based Web browsers). The standard is the result of collaboration by a number of participants, including AOL, IBM, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.

XML (Extensible Markup Language)

A W3C open standard for describing data using embedded tags. Unlike HTML, XML does not describe how to display elements on the page but rather defines what the elements contain. It has become the standard for business-to-business transactions, electronic-data interchanges and Web services.

XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language)

XSL associates presentation characteristics (e.g., layout) with the markup used in Extensible Markup Language (XML). One of the XML family of languages developed by the World Wide Web Consortium, XSL is used to create XML “stylesheets,” which describe how XML documents are presented. XSL provides independent control of presentation from content and can describe output of the same content to different formats (e.g., audio or print).

XSL is made up of three components:

• XSL Transformations (see XSLT)
• XML Path Language (see XPath)
• XSL Formatting Objects, an XML vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics

XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)

A component of Extensible Stylesheet Language (see XSL), XSLT controls views of Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents and the ordering of XML elements. It is used to create new content structures from existing structures or subsets, based on interest, access privileges or security, and it transforms XML structure to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).

X-Windows

The software system written for managing windows under Unix. A graphics architecture, application programming interface (API) and prototype implementation developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, X-Windows defines a client/server relationship between the applications program and the workstation. It is not, however, a complete graphical user interface (GUI), but rather the basis upon which one can be built.

Y

Yahoo Messenger

Free public IM service.

Z

zero latency

A goal to keep moving goods or information in the supply chain to provide near-real-time information management and reduce in-transit inventory costs.

ZigBee

Proprietary initiative based on IEEE 802.15.4 operating in the 2.4GHz band, with data rates less than 220 Kbps over 75 meters. It is designed for “command and control;” therefore, it does not support audio or video, but it can be used to send text messages and voice. A ZigBee network can control lights, fire or smoke detectors, thermostats or home-security systems. It can be used as a cable replacement technology. The ZigBee Alliance consists of 15 major promoters and 193 participating members. It is responsible for developing applications, as well as a certification process, program, logo and marketing strategy. It is a spinoff of the Home Radio Frequency Working Group.

ZLE (zero-latency enterprise)

Any strategy that exploits the immediate exchange of information across technical and organizational boundaries to achieve business benefit. For example, technical boundaries exist between different operating systems, database management systems and programming languages. “Immediate” implies being fast enough to bring all of the business benefits that simultaneous knowledge can potentially achieve. Latency cannot literally be zero in any real system because computers need time to “think.”

#

1xRTT (cdma2000 1x RTT)

A 2.5G transmission technology; an evolution of cdma2000 that adds voice capacity and supports peak downlink data rates of up to 144 Kbps in a single 1.25MHz channel, typically delivering 80 Kbps to 100 Kbps in the field.

2G (second generation)

The second generation of wireless networks designed to improve on analog with digital circuit-switched solutions. The three main 2G technology standards are Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), which is based on European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standards, time division multiple access (TDMA) IS-136 and code division multiple access (CDMA). The Japanese personal digital cellular (PDC) standard was similar to IS-136. GSM and IS-136 are TDMA technologies. 2G services typically support data rates of 9.6 Kbps, 14.4 Kbps and up to 64 Kbps in certain IS-95B deployments.

2.5G

Enhancements that provide packet data capabilities over 2G networks. 2.5G improves the available data rates supported by the air interface, thereby permitting the introduction of new, data-oriented services and applications. The increased data rates rise to a theoretical maximum of 384 Kbps, although in the field available data rates may often be as low as 20 Kbps. General packet radio service (GPRS) is an example of a 2.5G technology.

3G (third generation)

3G wireless networks support peak data rates of 144 Kbps at mobile user speeds, 384 Kbps at pedestrian user speeds and 2 Mbps in fixed locations (peak speeds), although some initial deployments were configured to support only 64 Kbps. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) coordinates 3G standards through its International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) project and incorporates the key standards bodies, Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and 3GPP2. See also High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) and Long Term Evolution (LTE).

3GDSL (third-generation DSL)

3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project)

3GPP2 (Third Generation Partnership Project 2)

3.5G

A broad term referring to enhancements that provide high-speed data extensions to 3G (wideband code division multiple access [WCDMA]) that go beyond the 384 Kbps downlink and 64 Kbps uplink provided by basic WCDMA. The term 3.5G covers technologies such as High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) and HSPA+.

3GPP (Third-Generation Partnership Project)

Collaborative project among various standards bodies, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and enterprise application integration-41 (EAI-41), under the auspices of the ITU, which is developing global specifications for the evolution of 3G technologies. 3GPP focuses on the evolution of GSM and WCDMA, while 3GPP2 focuses on the evolution of cdma2000.

4G (fourth generation)

Also known as International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT)-Advanced (IMT-A), 4G is the subject of a global standardization effort involving the ITU, 3GPP, 3GPP2, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), vendors and operators that aims to define the next-generation local-area and wide-area cellular platform. Spectrum assignments in the 450MHz to 470MHz and 698MHz to 872MHz bands were decided at the World Radiocommunication Conference in 2007 (WRC-07). Standardization has continued through 2009, and fully commercial services should be introduced by 2012.

Key 4G features are likely to include: support for peak data transmission rates of 100 Mbps (wide area) and 1 Gbps (fixed/low mobility); seamless hand-over between different wireless bearers; and an all-Internet Protocol (IP) core and radio transport for voice, video, multimedia and data services, as well as call control/signaling. 4G is likely to require orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), software-defined radio (SDR) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies. LTE is the ITU-defined evolution path for the GSM family to 4G, but WiMAX 802.16m is also a candidate.

5S

Five-part checklist to help eliminate waste in the workplace: In Japanese – “Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu and Shitsuke”; loosely translated as “Sort, Straighten, Sanitize, Standardize and Sustain.” Using the 5S approach is frequently a “kaizen event.”

5 whys

A form of root-cause analysis that entails asking “why” (at least) five times until the underlying causes of an outcome are understood.

7 wastes

A framework of seven types of activity that do not add value; originally defined by Toyota: overproducing – producing product before there’s a valid order; unnecessary waiting – lengthened cycle time, which reduces agility; unnecessary transportation – unnecessary transportation of material between sites; overprocessing – processes longer or more complex than necessary; unnecessary inventory – buildup of work-in-process or raw materials; unnecessary movement – inefficient workplace; layout causing extra work; and too many defects – poor process quality and too much rework. This list was extended to include an eighth waste: asset underutilization or other underutilization of resources. The eight wastes are often referred to by the acronym “DOWNTIME,” meaning “Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Nonutilized resources, Transportation, Inventory, Motion and Excessive processing.”

802.11

See Wi-Fi and wireless LAN (WLAN).

802.11-2007

Previously known as 802.11m, 802.11-2007 was approved in March 2007 and merges into a single authoritative document all previous amendments to the original 802.11 standard (a, b, d, e, g, h, i and j). It does not currently include 802.11n. See also 802.11a through to 802.11j.

802.11a

Standard for the physical layer of WLANs operating at 5GHz. The number of available channels depends on the country where the system is operating, with 13 channels available in the U.S. and 11 more pending local ratification of the global ITU agreement governing these frequencies. The maximum link rate is 54 Mbps per channel, but maximum user throughput will be about half this, and the throughput is shared by all users of the same radio channel. Frequency bands for 802.11a may differ in different parts of the world. See also Wi-Fi and WLAN.

802.11b

Standard for the physical layer of WLANs operating at 2.4GHz. It has 11 defined radio channels, which provide three non-overlapping channels when deployed. The maximum link rate is 11 Mbps per channel. Data rates fall off as the distance between the user and the radio access point increases. See also Wi-Fi and WLAN.

802.11d

Supplement to the Media Access Control (MAC) layer in the base 802.11 WLAN standard. It aims to promote worldwide use of 802.11. It will enable access points to communicate information on the permissible radio channels and at power levels acceptable to user devices. The current 802.11 standards cannot operate legally in some countries, and the purpose of 802.11d is to add features and restrictions to WLAN systems that would enable them to operate in the specific regulatory guidelines of these countries. See also Wi-Fi and WLAN.

802.11e

Supplement to the MAC layer to provide quality of service (QoS) support for LAN applications. The amendment was approved in 2005 and was integrated into the standard as part of 802.11-2007. This applies to all 802.11 physical-layer standards (a, b and g). The purpose is to provide classes of service with managed QoS levels for data, voice and video applications.

802.11f

Recommended practice document. It aims to achieve access point interoperability within a multivendor WLAN network. The document defines the registration of access points within a network and the interchange of information among access points in case of the handover of users. See also Wi-Fi and WLAN.

802.11g

Physical-layer standard for WLANs in the 2.4GHz radio band. It has 11 defined channels that, when deployed, provide three nonoverlapping radio channels with a maximum link rate of up to 54 Mbps per channel. Support for complementary code keying modulation makes 802.11g backward compatible with 802.11b. The addition of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and packet binary convolution coding modulation schemes achieves higher link rates. See also Wi-Fi and WLAN.

802.11h

Supplement to the MAC layer to meet the regulatory provisions for European 5GHz WLANs. It was integrated into the standard as part of 802.11-2007. European radio regulations for the 5GHz band require products to have transmission power control (TPC) and dynamic frequency selection (DFS). TPC limits the transmit power to the minimum needed to reach the farthest user, while DFS selects the radio channel at the access point to minimize interference with other systems (interference with radar systems is of particular concern). See also Wi-Fi and WLAN.

802.11i

Supplement to the MAC layer to provide improved WLAN security. It applies to all 802.11 physical standards (a, b and g). The purpose is to provide an alternative to Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) with new encryption methods and authentication procedures. A key part of 802.11i is Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1X. See also 802.1X, WEP, Wi-Fi, WLAN, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and WPA2.

802.11j

The 802.11j standard specifies 802.11 WLAN operation in the 4.9GHz to 5GHz band to conform to Japanese radio operation rules for indoor and outdoor radio use. The standard was finalized in 2004. This specification paved the way for public safety bands at 4.9GHz in other geographic locales. Public-safety channels are dedicated for such use and although still “public,” these channels are not available for general use. 802.11j also defines uniform methods that let access points move to new frequencies or change channel width for better performance or capacity – for example, to avoid interference with other wireless applications.

802.11m

An obsolete term for a maintenance effort to re-craft the master 802.11 specification incorporating the various amendments that have been approved to date. This task was completed in 2007, and the new master specification is now known as 802.11-2007. See also 802.11-2007.

802.11n

A extension of 802.11 technology intended to increase the network speed up to 600 Mbps and to improve the operating range. 802.11n accomplishes these improvements through changes in the MAC layer, frequency banding (which expands the communication channel from 20MHz to 40MHz) and the addition of MIMO technology, which uses multiple antennas at the source (transmitter) and destination (receiver) to optimize speed and range. 802.11n is not expected to be ratified by the IEEE 802.11n task group until the first half of 2010, with certification in place later in 2010. Pre-802.11n Draft 2 equipment may be certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance to be compatible with the final standard.

802.11r-2008

An amendment ratified in 2008 that governs the way roaming clients communicate with access points for reassociation, reauthentication and QoS resources. It is aimed at refining the transition process and minimizing latency as a mobile client moves among access points.

802.11s

An IEEE working group formed in July 2005 that is defining a protocol for autoconfiguring paths among access points in a wireless mesh network distribution system. The original 15 proposals were whittled down to two sets of ideas in January 2006 – one from the Wi-Mesh Alliance (WiMA), led by Nortel and other communication organizations, and the other from the SEEMesh group backed by Intel, Nokia, Motorola, NTT DoCoMo and Texas Instruments. In March 2006, these two groups merged to create a single joint proposal, which the IEEE working group has approved.

802.11t

Also called Wireless Performance Prediction (WPP). The goal of the 802.11t project is to provide a set of recommended measurement methods, performance metrics and test recommendations that enable manufacturers, independent test labs, service providers and end users to measure the performance of IEEE 802.11 standard equipment and networks. 802.11t will not be considered a standard.

802.11u

Concerned with improvements to internetworking with external networks. 802.11 has focused on providing service for pre-authorized users. 802.11u covers users that are not pre-authorized but have a relationship with an external network. This will permit a limited set of services, such as emergency calls.

802.11v

Intended to deal with wireless network management. 801.11v will focus on the configuration of client devices while they are connected to IEEE 802.11 networks. The standard may include cellular-like management paradigms, such as listing only access points that have a cooperative arrangement with the user’s home service.

802.11w

Targeted toward increasing the security of WLAN management frames. WLAN data is encrypted, but management frames are not. Although vulnerability is low and mostly related to denial-of-service attacks, this would be a last step in completely securing all aspects of WLAN transmissions. The adoption of 802.11w would remove threats caused by malicious systems that attack through repeated disassociation requests appearing to be sent by valid equipment. 802.11w will work with 802.11r and 802.11u.

802.15

Working group of the IEEE focusing on standards for short-distance wireless networks, such as wireless personal-area networks (WPAN). WPANs address wireless networking of portable- and mobile-computing devices, such as PCs, PDAs, peripherals, cell phones, pagers and consumer electronics, enabling these devices to communicate and interoperate with one another.

802.16 (WiMAX)

The IEEE 802.16 Working Group on Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) Standards is developing standards and recommended practices to support the development and deployment of broadband wireless metropolitan-area networks (WMANs). 802.16 was designed to bring broadband wireless connectivity into buildings from an ISP or other carrier, offering an alternative to wired T1 and DSL lines in the last mile. It can be used to provide high-speed connectivity among Wi-Fi networks across large campuses and to create a WMAN throughout a city, suburb or region. The WiMAX Forum promotes 802.16 standards and provides interoperability certification. See also 802.16-2004, 802.16e-2005, 802.16m.

802.16-2004 (fixed WiMAX)

Originally known as 802.16d, this approved standard uses 2GHz to 11GHz frequencies, which can penetrate walls and other dense objects. 802.16-2004 provides transmission to stationary devices and replaces prior 802.16 and 802.16a specifications. The WiMAX Forum industry certification process for 802.16-2004 has been in place since early 2007.

802.16a

Approved in 2002, the original (and now obsolete) 802.16a standard provided for up to 70 Mbps of shared point-to-multipoint transmission in the 10GHz to 66GHz frequency bands, as far as 37 miles.

802.16e-2005 (mobile WiMAX)

Originally known as 802.16e, 802.16e-2005 is an evolving extension of 802.16-2004 for mobile use in the 2GHz to 6GHz band. It enables people to communicate while walking or moving at vehicular speeds. Products conforming to 802.16e-2005 may be used as infrastructure for fixed, semi-mobile and mobile networks. WiMAX Forum compliance and interoperability certification testing for 802.16e-2005 began in late 2007, and it was admitted into the IMT-2000 3G standard. In June of 2009 the WiMAX Forum announced that certification will replace wave testing with a testing procedure in three modules for more clarity and transparency. Those modules encompass radiated performance testing and network conformance testing for all profiles in a commercial retail launch, which will enable any operator to bring forward requirements on the networking side to be included. Certification of Tri-Mode devices for 2.3 GHz, 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz is due to begin in 1Q10.

802.16m

The 802.16 Task Group m (TGm) is working on a draft standard that will define a new air interface supporting data rates of up to 100 Mbps for mobile applications and 1 Gbps for fixed applications. 802.16m will require 20MHz or more of bandwidth and, as with LTE, will likely use OFMDA, MIMO and spatial division multiple access (SDMA). TGm is aiming to complete the standard and to submit it to the IEEE for approval by late 2009. 802.16m will support both frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) simultaneously, so this will assist operators that do not have access to FDD spectrum. In the IMT-A discussion, LTE-A and 802.16m could be compatible, but this would inhibit the principle of backward interoperability with 802.16e.2005.

802.1X

The IEEE WLAN security standard 802.11i includes the 802.1X framework for authentication. 802.1X uses Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), which works on wired and wireless LANs for message exchange during the authentication process. In a wireless LAN with 802.1X, there are three main components:

• A supplicant – Client software on a device requesting authentication for the network.
• An authenticator – Access point to which the user is trying to connect.
• An authentication server – Returns an accept or reject message to the access point.

A client is authenticated to the network through a series of EAP messages exchanged among the supplicant, authenticator and authentication server.

802.20 (mobile wireless broadband)

Unlike the 802.16 task group, the IEEE 802.20 task group has been working on a specifically mobile wireless broadband standard. This group originally included proprietary wireless broadband vendors such as ArrayComm, Flarion Technologies (acquired by Qualcomm in 2005) and IPWireless (now NextWave Wireless), which already have commercial deployments. However, because of a lack of any real progress, during 2004 this group suffered defections to 802.16e-2005, and the 802.20 standards effort is not expected to survive. 802.20 aims to provide high-speed wireless connectivity to mobile users even when they are traveling at speeds of up to 250 km per hour.

802.22

Developing technology for use in the metropolitan-area network (MAN) and beyond for frequency bands of 900MHz and below (replacing the U.S. analog TV spectrum).

802.3af

Part of 802.3-2005, clause 33 is commonly referred as 802.3af or Power Over Ethernet (PoE). 802.3af is a technology that transmits up to 12.95W of usable electrical power, along with data, to remote devices over standard twisted-pair cable in an Ethernet network. See also 802.3at and PoE.

802.3at

A future standard that is being worked on by the IEEE 802.3at task group. It is commonly referred to as PoE+ and will boost the usable power transmitted to over 30W using category five or higher cable. See also 802.3af and PoE.
