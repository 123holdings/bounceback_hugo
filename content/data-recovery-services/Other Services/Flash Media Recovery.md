## Description:

Flash media is undoubtedly one of the most exciting new data storage mediums thanks to fast read/write speeds and a lack of moving parts. However, while flash devices are generally more reliable than hard drives, data loss can still occur for a number of reasons, including:

- Overheating
- Power surges
- Accidental file deletion
- File corruption

Flash media data recovery can be extremely difficult, as standard techniques are usually ineffective. Repairing and replacing components can be a difficult and complex process, especially with SD cards, MicroSD and other common formats. Flash data recovery requires specialized equipment and knowledge of newer data recovery techniques.

At BounceBack data recovery, we have performed data recovery on various flash formats since they became popular with consumers in the early 2000’s. We have invested in training and equipment and offer some of the highest recovery rates in the world for flash, including all types of camera cards, thumb drives, and storage devices.

Flash media also present more complexity in the data recovery process due to the variety of proprietary data organization and encryption codes. The data recovery experts at BounceBack have years of experience working with flash media. At BounceBack we are equipped to meet this need with our ISO certified cleanroom and with the unrivaled expertise of our technicians.

If your flash media has failed, we recommend taking the following steps:

- Immediately disconnect the flash media. Although flash drives do not have moving parts like a standard hard drive, file corruption and other issues can become more complex if the media is accessed continuously after a failure. This is an especially important step to take if data was accidentally deleted or lost through any other sort of normal operation.
- Contact a data recovery expert at BounceBack. Some simple issues can be fixed over the phone while serious corruption or physical issues will need to be resolved in lab. Describe the problem to our experts and we’ll try to determine the best course of action.
- Always take precautions to prevent static shock damage to flash media and package your cards and drives carefully before shipping.

The chances of a successful flash drive data recovery are fairly high. Contact us today for more information or set up a case through our online form to schedule a free evaluation.
