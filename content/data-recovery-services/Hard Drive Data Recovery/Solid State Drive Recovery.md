## Description:

Solid state drives are a newer technology that combines the speed of flash memory with the flexibility of a standard hard drive. Some newer computers ship with SSD’s, especially laptops and net books. Many computer users decide to purchase solid state drives when building PCs to improve the data read/write speeds of their computers.

Solid state drives are thought to be more dependable than typical hard drives because they don’t have any moving parts. However, data loss can still occur for a number of reasons including power surges, accidental deletion, and file corruption.

BounceBack Data Recovery is one of the few data recovery companies in the world with the technology to recover data from SSD’s. Our engineers repair electrical issues to clone your solid state drive before using in-lab software to recover each file. BounceBack has a higher success rate with SSD’s than many other companies because of our extensive experience working with this type of drive.

To improve the chances of a successful solid state drive data recovery, we recommend the following tips:

- Don’t run data recovery software on a solid state drive. Many data recovery programs are designed to work with a traditional hard drive and can cause damage to an SSD’s data. Only use data recovery software if it has been specifically designed for use with a solid state drive.
- Turn an SSD drive off immediately if data has been deleted accidentally. The longer a drive runs, the higher the chances that the deleted data will be overwritten. Turning the drive off improves the chances of a successful solid state drive data recovery.
- Any data recovery company attempting an SSD data recovery should have electronic repair and firmware equipment designed specifically for solid state drives. Only use a data recovery company that has experience with solid state drives.
