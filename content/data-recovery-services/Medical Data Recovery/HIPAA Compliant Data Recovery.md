## Description:

BounceBack Data Recovery will happily work with your organization to ensure that your data recovery job is HIPAA compliant. Per the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, all covered entities must have business associate contracts with those companies with whom it is necessary for them to share private records or data.

BounceBack uses a standard non-disclosure agreement available to any customer on request. We understand, however, that there are mandatory provisions enumerated in the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the HIPAA Security Rule that may not be met by a standard agreement. Contract stipulations may also vary based on the type of services that your organization provides to your customers. Because of this, BounceBack is willing to sign any HIPAA-required non-disclosure agreement provided to us by the customer.

At BounceBack, the privacy of your organization’s data is guaranteed. We do not share any information related to your data recovery case with any outside entity. We know that not only is patient privacy of supreme importance but the privacy of your organization is as well. We never share or advertise the fact that a business utilized our services without permission.

We can also guarantee stringent security standards around the clock at our facilities that will meet your HIPAA compliance needs. We are protected around the clock by a Cisco Self-Defending Network. We offer enhanced security data recovery services which include a chain of custody protocol, fireproof safe storage and a non-disclosure agreement. Encrypted data recovery services are also available for customers who are prevented from releasing their encryption key. Any clones made during the recovery process are destroyed upon completion of the job.

In short, BounceBack Data Recovery is equipped with the security measures and the privacy guarantees that will allow us to be your HIPAA compliant partner. Again, we are happy to sign any HIPAA non-disclosure forms that you provide. For more information, call us or set up a case today
