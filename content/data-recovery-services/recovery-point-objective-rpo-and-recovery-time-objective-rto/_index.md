## Description:

At BounceBack Data Recovery we want to be an integral part of your plans to meet your recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO). We can help with data recovery, backup implementation and retrieval, and meeting your time goals when minutes matter.

RPO is simply the amount of time relative to disaster that an organization plans to recover their data. The RPO is expressed backward in time. Once it has been defined, the RPO determines the minimum frequency that backups are made. For example, if the RPO is 24 hours, backups of data will be made every day. RPO is an important consideration in disaster recovery planning. How you define your RPO will determine what type of media you use for backup storage and how long you keep those backups.

RTO is the maximum length of time that a computer system or network can be down after a failure occurs. Different business functions with the same organization may have different RTOs. Payroll’s RTO may be two weeks while the RTO for purchase order processing may be two days. RTO is determined by formulas that take into account loss per time unit. Long story short, you need a data recovery company that can get you back up and running as soon as possible.

BounceBack Data Recovery can help you in meeting your RTO and RPO goals. We understand that downtime for your organization translates into dollars down the drain. Failure to meet recovery point objectives and recovery time objectives can bring a company to the brink of disaster or beyond. Any case involving RTO and RPO time windows is given top priority at BounceBack. Call us today to find out how BounceBack Data Recovery can help with your disaster recovery planning.
