## Description:

The experts at BounceBack Data Recovery employ highly successful and tested methods to get your SAN or NAS back in service.

SAN is an acronym for Storage Area Network. NAS stands for Network Attached Storage. Simply put, both NAS and SAN are intended to store large amounts of data that can be easily accessed by any computer attached to their network. A NAS will appear to your operating system as a file server, while a SAN will appear as a disk.

At BounceBack, we understand that downtime for your SAN or NAS means downtime for your company. We make every SAN/NAS recovery job a top priority so your network can get up and running as soon as possible. In many cases, BounceBack is able to remotely access the network and recover your data.

We also recognize the sensitive nature of data stored on servers. BounceBack can guarantee total security when it comes to your private files. BounceBack has a Cisco Self-Defending Network and any clones made in the recovery process are destroyed upon completion of the job.

Your SAN or NAS recovery job will be handled with the highest level of customer service and professionalism. BounceBack can give you that peace of mind because we have earned to following certifications to guarantee that if your data is recoverable, we will recover it:
