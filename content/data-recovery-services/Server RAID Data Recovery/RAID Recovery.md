## Description:

A RAID array can store terabytes of information or serve as a simple back-up for a home PC. As many RAID levels offer built-in redundancy, they are considered to be a safe way to store data. Most businesses with IT departments operate at least one major RAID server. While one or more drives could fail on a RAID 5 without causing data loss, user error, electrical malfunctions and natural disasters can quickly bring even a fully redundant server down.

RAID data recovery can be a complex and delicate process. Data recovery engineers must have experience with different striping techniques and need to have a working knowledge of dozens of different RAID cards. Each case needs to be carefully evaluated and the RAID itself needs to be reconstructed on a bit level.

Many data recovery companies don’t have the tools and experience to handle large RAID cases. BounceBack Data Recovery’s technicians have years of experience tackling the complexities presented by RAID system data loss. Whether you have a three-drive RAID 5 or a complex RAID 0+1 setup, you’ll need a competent team of experts that can explain your options and take a safe, efficient approach to returning your files.

BounceBack works with any RAID level, including

| RAID 0   | RAID 1   | RAID 3   | RAID 4  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
| RAID 5   | RAID 6   | RAID 1E  | RAID 5E |
| RAID 5EE | RAID ADG | RAID 0+1 | RAID 10 |
| RAID 50  | RAID 51  | —        | —       |

BounceBack Data Recovery’s RAID services are designed to be fast and safe. Each case is evaluated before any work is done to provide an accurate price quote. Individual drives are repaired and the RAID is reconstructed using state of the art virtualization technology. Our RAID data recovery services also come with a data guarantee.
