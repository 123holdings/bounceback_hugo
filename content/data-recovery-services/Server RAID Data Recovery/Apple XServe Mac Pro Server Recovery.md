## Description:

XServe systems can make for complex recoveries as they typically use the HFS+ file system. Most commercial RAID recovery software isn’t designed for use on the HFS+ machines. We circumvent this problem by developing in-house tools specifically for use with XServe technology. BounceBack’s technicians are trained to recover data from all Xserve and Mac Pro Server systems including:

- Xserve G4
- Xserve 65
- Intel Xserve
- Xserve RAID
- Mac Pro Server
- Mac Mini Server

The Apple Xserve is a rack mounted server, first introduced in 2002. It went through a number of upgrades until 2010, when it was discontinued. It was replaced by the Mac Pro Server and the Mac Mini Server. The Mac Pro Server offers dual or triple boot configurations, allowing multiple operating systems on the machine, including Microsoft Windows 7 and Mac OS/X. At BounceBack we can handle data recovery on your Apple Xserve, Mac Pro Server, or Mac Mini Server no matter what the operating system.

We understand the sensitive nature of data stored on servers. BounceBack can guarantee total security when it comes to your private files. BounceBack has a Cisco Self-Defending Network and any clones made in the recovery process are destroyed upon completion of the job.

Apple Xserve and Mac Pro Server present data recovery concerns that can often be more complex than those exhibited by simpler machines. If the data loss is non-mechanical in nature, our technicians may be able to address the problem remotely, saving your organization from excessive downtime and loss of business. When the cause is mechanical you can rest assured that your trained technicians will work to recover your data in a Class 100 ISO certified clean room, thus ensuring no further damage.
